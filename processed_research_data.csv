Indiana prisoners training with IUPUI program to become peer health resources







For Immediate Release

            Jul 31, 2019
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – Public health researchers at IUPUI are training some Indiana prisoners to become health resources and advocates for their peers as part of a worldwide program to improve health among underserved populations.


  The Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI’s ECHO Center is the first site to replicate Project ECHO’s prison peer education program, launched in 2009 in New Mexico. Project ECHO, or Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, is an innovative videoconferencing approach to sharing medical knowledge and training health care providers.





      IUPUI’s Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO graduated its first class of peer educators at Plainfield Correctional Facility, members of which proudly displayed their diplomas.

  IUPUI’s Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO team, also known as INPEP, is training people who are incarcerated to become peer health educators. Graduates of the program can then pass on knowledge to their peers about common health conditions affecting prison populations, including infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, staph/MRSA skin infections and tuberculosis; mental health issues such as suicide risk, depression and anxiety; HIV and other sexually transmitted infections; diabetes; and addiction.


  These peer educators communicate strategies to reduce risky behaviors and serve as key resources for health information within the prisons, in addition to developing skills in self-efficacy, responsibility and leadership that can carry over into their lives after incarceration.


  Andrea Janota, program coordinator at the ECHO Center, said the Indiana Peer Education Program’s model is that “prison health is public health.”


  “Over 95 percent of people who are incarcerated will return to their home communities,” Janota said. “The Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO is a train-the-trainer model that provides an extraordinary opportunity to improve not only the health of people who are incarcerated, but also the health of their families and communities.”


  Twenty men from the Correctional Industrial Facility in Pendleton and the Plainfield Correctional Facility completed the 40-hour peer education training program in June and have begun hosting weekly health education workshops with their peers.


  Janota said the peer health educators are talented and energetic facilitators who are able to use their lived experiences to reach their peers in ways that those who have never been incarcerated cannot. In addition to supporting health and safety in prisons, the program provides trainees with much more than health education.


  “It provides the chance to be part of something, to be part of a community,” she said. “While the program prepares peer educators with a strong understanding of health topics and preventative measures, it also helps them develop a professional skill set that is applicable anywhere in the workforce.”


  The Indiana Peer Education Program is a collaboration between the ECHO Center at IUPUI, Step-Up Inc., the Indiana Department of Correction and the Viral Hepatitis Program at the Indiana State Department of Health.


  This project reflects Indiana University’s extensive expertise and research regarding addictions. To build on this area of strength, IU President Michael A. McRobbie, along with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and IU Health President and CEO Dennis Murphy, announced the Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge initiative in October 2017.

Student-led project helps community make and distribute free masks








            Nov 3, 2020
          









  A group of Indiana University Bloomington students who are passionate about promoting mask-wearing to stop the spread of COVID-19 are playing a key volunteer role in a community effort to provide people with masks.





      Nearly 80 Indiana University Bloomington students are part of The Mask Project at IU, which helps the Bloomington Mask Drive by making masks and helping with packaging, distribution and promotion.Photo courtesy of Arianna Smith
    



The Mask Project at IU, involving nearly 80 students who are mostly on pre-medicine or pre-health tracks, has been helping Bloomington Mask Drive make, package and distribute masks since mid-September. They are free for any person who needs one and available at eight locations across Bloomington, including the Forrest Avenue entrance to Luddy Hall on the IU campus.


  Bloomington Mask Drive co-founder Kelly Clark said the contributions of the students cannot be overstated.


  “They will do anything we ask them for, and they can always fit it into their schedules, and they are so willing to help and so flexible,” she said. “They inject so much energy into Bloomington Mask Drive.”


  The community initiative started in March as a partnership between Clark, a physical therapist, and Nola Hartman, a member of the Bloomington Quilters Guild, and has resulted more than 38,000 masks made.


  Sophomore Arianna Smith said she cares about community health and felt a responsibility to get involved in the fight against the pandemic, so she started The Mask Project at IU. It was born out of a positive experience she had with a similar initiative earlier this year.


  After returning home to Crown Point, Indiana, in March, when the pandemic prompted IU to send students home and shift classes to online instruction, Smith volunteered with NWI Masks. The initiative in Northwest Indiana provided personal protective equipment to essential health care workers.


  When Smith returned to IU in the fall, she wanted to do something similar here. An online search for local mask initiatives revealed the Bloomington Mask Drive. Smith contacted Clark, and they discussed how IU students could help. That prompted Smith to create The Mask Project at IU.

  Smith used social media to attract students to her project, which is primarily focused on assisting Bloomington Mask Drive.


  The students sew, sort and package the masks. They deliver materials to those who sew masks and take finished masks to the distribution locations. They also promote Bloomington Mask Drive on Instagram.


  “It’s been the most valuable experience I’ve had in my life,” Smith said.


  Marlee Vinson, a sophomore and neuroscience major, said she wanted to play an active role in ending the pandemic, and helping with a mask initiative was one way to contribute.


  “In my opinion, wearing a mask is an act of love to those around you; it’s like saying, ‘I see you, and I’m trying to protect you’ to every single person you come in contact with,” Vinson said.


  She’s sewn masks, sorted them, tested the elastics, packaged masks, prepared the distribution bags and distributed masks.


  “This makes me feel that I am making a difference in the community,” Vinson said.


  Sophomore Lenna Gottschild joined The Mask Project at IU because she had been wanting to make masks since the start of the pandemic and saw it as an opportunity to learn the mask-making process. She also likes that the project benefits the greater health and community of Bloomington.


  “Getting to spend a few hours a week socializing and doing something productive does good to the soul,” Gottschild said.


  The Mask Project at IU also has a campus initiative called “My Mask Matters.” Other IU students are asked to write on a white board why their mask matters and a social media post is created, all to promote a mask culture on campus and foster empathy, Smith said.


  “We are a group of students who care about wearing masks and promoting safety on and off campus,” Smith said.

  That care also is demonstrated by some IU employees who have volunteered with Bloomington Mask Drive, and helped secure Luddy Hall as a distribution location.


  Benita Brown and Lynne Mikolon, who both work in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, and are experienced at sewing, started making masks for Bloomington Mask Drive in March.


  “Making fabric masks lets me be creative and helpful,” Brown said. “Having an interesting mask might just encourage people to wear them, which is beneficial to all of us.”


  Clark said Brown and Mikolon approached Jill Clancy, an event planner for the Luddy School, about using the building as a place to distribute masks.


  “Luddy is a great place to have masks available on campus so that anyone can come by and pick one up,” Mikolon said.


  Clancy, who helps by buying and cutting fabric for Brown and Mikolon, worked with Bloomington Mask Drive to establish Luddy Hall as a distribution point. Near the entrance sits a large self-serve box – painted by Clancy – with the masks and signage, as well as information about Bloomington Mask Drive. It also has slots for monetary and fabric donations.


  “It’s worked really well so far,” Clancy said.


  Kell Mirowski, a Bloomington Mask Drive volunteer who works part-time for IU in the College of Arts and Sciences, has helped Clark by leading coordination efforts with The Mask Project, allowing Clark to return to patient care at her clinic.

Indiana Institute on Disability and Community adds research center







For Immediate Release

            Feb 25, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – The Eppley Institute for Parks and Public Lands will become the seventh Indiana Institute on Disability and Community research center this summer, Indiana University Bloomington has announced.


  As Indiana’s federally designated University Center for Excellence in Disabilities, the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community, established in 1970, is known across the state and nation as a leader in research, education and service to advance inclusive and equitable communities for all people, including those with significant disabilities. The inclusion of the Eppley Institute under the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community umbrella provides a unique opportunity to expand the impact of the Indiana Institute into new spaces – national, state and local parks and public lands.








  “Our campus is committed to inclusion and fostering multidisciplinary work that supports Indiana communities,” said Lauren Robel, IU Bloomington provost and executive vice president. “Uniting the research missions of the Eppley Institute and the IIDC will enable both organizations to more effectively impact our partner communities.”


  “All people have the right to live, recreate and be fully included in their community,” said Derek Nord, director of the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community and associate professor of special education in the School of Education at IU Bloomington. “One’s disability status should not dictate these outcomes. Through the Eppley Institute’s extensive work with park systems and the collaborative opportunities that exist with the IIDC’s six centers, the research and innovation opportunities are many.”


  Established in 1993 by Indiana University, the Eppley Institute partners with recreation, park and public land organizations to enhance access, choice and quality of natural, cultural and recreational experiences for all people.


  “Our mission and values dovetail with the work of the IIDC,” said Steve Wolter, Eppley Institute director. “The projects conducted by Eppley have had significant impacts to community health, quality of place and experiences for all peoples. The way in which Eppley will interconnect with the six centers at IIDC will be an extraordinary force for Indiana University and also for the professions and agencies that we serve.”


  The Indiana Institute on Disability and Community is one of 21 research centers, institutes and museums overseen by IU Bloomington’s Office of the Vice Provost for Research, which works to foster excellence in research and creative activities.


  “The IIDC is a leader in interdisciplinary, applied research that advances change in the state and country,” said Jeff Zaleski, interim vice provost for research. “Together, the Indiana Institute and programs at Eppley will be even better positioned to create new opportunities for sharing of ideas and innovations that benefit everyone.”

Senior food insecurity connected to isolation, program barriers in rural areas


            IU study also reveals a concerning increase in loneliness among seniors due to the pandemic
          






For Immediate Release

            Nov 16, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – As food insecurity rises among older adults in the United States, a new study from Indiana University is uncovering factors that prevent older residents from accessing the food they need.


  Little research has been done to understand how lower-income older adults manage to meet their food needs – or don’t – especially in rural areas. The IU study, conducted by the Sustainable Food Systems Science Initiative in partnership with the IU Center for Rural Engagement, relies on 10 public discussions in fall 2019 held in Crawford, Greene, Lawrence and Orange counties to learn more about food provisioning methods – the ways that seniors “make do” with the food resources they have.

  To further assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food provisioning, the research team also surveyed 5,000 households in lower-income census tracts across Crawford, Greene, Lawrence and Orange counties during April, May and June 2020.


  Seniors who participated in the discussions and survey reported that living alone decreases their motivation to prepare balanced meals and reduced joy from eating. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated those feelings, the survey found, significantly increasing seniors’ feelings of loneliness, making them feel left out and isolated.


  While 23 percent of those surveyed felt “left out” often or sometimes before the pandemic, 40 percent felt so after it began. Similarly, 7 percent felt “isolated” often or sometimes before the pandemic, but 61 percent felt so after the pandemic started. And while 25 percent felt they “lacked companionship” often or sometimes before the pandemic, 42 percent felt so after.


  “The jump in loneliness indicators with the onset of the pandemic was perhaps the most concerning finding,” said Dan Knudsen, professor emeritus in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Geography, and affiliate faculty with the Critical Food Studies Laboratory at the IU Food Institute and the Center for Rural Engagement. “The sharp increase in feelings of isolation may speak to a need for a concerted mental health push this winter, a season that is bad generally for seniors, and with the prospects for a ‘twindemic’ may be devastatingly so.”


  In contrast, seniors who live with children and/or grandchildren explained that sharing in shopping and cooking routines and eating together with families helped them to eat better.


  “Congregate meals, like those offered at senior centers or churches, where people can share a meal and engage socially with others, are hugely appreciated by the seniors we interviewed,” said project partner Phil Stafford of Commons Planning Inc. “However, many communities have seen these meals dwindle, and even regular meal services like Meals on Wheels have reduced deliveries to frozen meal packs twice a month in some areas.”


  Transportation is another major barrier to food access for older rural residents who no longer drive. Public buses are few or non-existent, rural transit is limited, and Medicaid cab services will provide rides only to a medical appointment for those who qualify. Seniors rely on family members, neighbors and friends for rides, but they sometimes cannot afford what a driver might ask them to chip in. A ride-share network could offer access and cost-effective opportunities for seniors, the researchers suggest.


  For older residents who are watching their budgets or on fixed incomes, it is typical for food to rank as a lower priority than rent, utility and medical payments. Seniors navigate food assistance programs including local food pantries and food box drops, but residents interviewed reported that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, commonly known as food stamps) is complicated and limited to about $13 to $15 per month in benefits on average, pre-COVID-19.


  “SNAP and other programs often involve paperwork that discourages participation given the low benefit amounts, the costs of getting to welfare offices, and perceptions of need and eligibility,” said Angela Babb, assistant scientist at the Ostrom Workshop, director at the Critical Food Studies Laboratory and faculty affiliate at the Center for Rural Engagement.


  As a nutritionally vulnerable population, seniors have distinct food needs to manage health conditions such as renal disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure or cholesterol. They are often prescribed foods low in sodium, sugar or phosphorus or high in potassium or calcium, which are largely not available to them through food programs.


  The survey indicated that those who struggled with food security before the COVID-19 pandemic continued to do so, and those who were food secure largely remained food secure. However, food provisioning strategies changed significantly.


  In the case of food sources, there was a dramatic decline in the reliance on restaurants and food directly received from farmers, and a corresponding increase in provisioning from grocery stores and supermarkets, delivery services and relatives, friends and neighbors. The frequency of provisioning also declined, from multiple times per week and weekly to biweekly and monthly food provisioning.


  The research team will continue to analyze the survey results in the coming months as they begin the third phase of analysis to gain additional insights into regular food provisioning routines among food-insecure seniors in the region. The study will conclude in summer 2021 with a series of workshops to devise strategies to relieve food insecurity among senior citizens in the region.


  This study is part of the IU Center for Rural Engagement’s efforts to improve the health and resilience of Indiana’s rural communities and develop replicable initiatives for communities across the nation. Additional funding for the COVID-19 pandemic survey came from the IU Office of the Vice President for Research.

Indiana cities to develop climate action plans in partnership with IU







For Immediate Release

            Mar 9, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Eleven Indiana cities will develop plans in 2020 to address greenhouse gas emissions as part of the next phase of Indiana University’s Resilience Cohort program.


  Program participants in 2020 are Carmel, Elkhart, Evansville, Fishers, Fort Wayne, Gary, Goshen, Michigan City, Richmond, West Lafayette and Zionsville.


  Building on the success of the 2019 Resilience Cohort, local governments will work with IU students and staff to identify actions, policies and programs to reduce emissions, an important step toward building community resilience against climate change.


  The Resilience Cohort program matches Hoosier communities with the tools, training and expertise needed to measure and reduce local greenhouse gas emissions. The program was launched in summer 2019 through a partnership between Sustain IU and the Environmental Resilience Institute, part of the IU Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative.

  Last year, 14 local governments representing Indiana cities, towns and counties joined the Resilience Cohort program and completed greenhouse gas inventories for the first time. Before that, Indianapolis, Bloomington and South Bend were the only Indiana cities to have conducted greenhouse gas inventories of their own. Now local governments representing 35 percent of the state’s population have completed inventories using recent data.


  In 2020, cohort members will develop greenhouse gas reduction plans, also known as climate action plans, that outline specific activities the communities will undertake to achieve reduced emissions targets. The plans will then be presented to elected officials for review and approval by the end of the year.


  “We are thrilled that so many cities in the state have decided to take the important step of developing a climate action plan,” Environmental Resilience Institute Director Janet McCabe said. “Once adopted, these plans will provide a tailored roadmap for each community to address local sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.


  “In addition to lowering a community’s climate impact, implementing these plans will lead to immediate community benefits like green jobs, lower utility bills and improved air quality. Preparing a plan could even help communities with their bond ratings as ratings agencies start to take into account cities’ vulnerabilities to climate impacts.”


  As part of the program, eight of the cities will receive IU student externs through Sustain IU’s Indiana Sustainability Development Program. The summer externs will help local governments coordinate community input and prioritize reduction actions.

  Cohort participants gain access to technical resources and training through ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, a nonprofit organization that specializes in helping local governments with emissions management and climate action. The training will help each city set goals, forecast multiple greenhouse gas scenarios and engage community stakeholders before drafting a climate action plan.


  “Partnering with IU and its students has helped ICLEI to accelerate our work with local governments across the state,” ICLEI Executive Director Angie Fyfe said. “Many communities are committed to climate action but under-resourced, limiting their ability to move forward. The Resilience Cohorts are an excellent combination of technical and local know-how. This hands-on approach enables cities and towns to succeed in ways they otherwise could not.”


  Participation in the program has aided cities like Fort Wayne in their ongoing efforts to be a leader in climate response, said Doug Fasick, the city of Fort Wayne’s senior program manager for energy engineering and sustainability services.


  “Because of this program, the city of Fort Wayne completed a greenhouse gas inventory last summer,” Fasick said. “Now we’re beginning a process to work with the public to identify ways to reduce those emissions. Under Mayor Tom Henry’s leadership, we’re committed to doing more with renewable energy to help make a lasting difference for residents, neighborhoods and businesses in Fort Wayne.”


  Funding for the 2020 Resilience Cohort program is provided by the McKinney Family Foundation and the Duke Energy Foundation.

  They may not be able to meet in person, but that doesn’t mean the Indiana University School of Education in Bloomington hasn’t found creative ways to help students in need.


  IU teacher candidates and School of Education staff volunteers are offering free virtual tutoring for K-12 students across the state starting this week. The service will continue until Thanksgiving.


  Tyna Hunnicutt, the co-director of clinical experiences and director of early field experience in the School of Education, said the one-hour Zoom sessions will be available twice a week for a K-12 student who has signed up for the service.


  “I had students reaching out to me asking if there were ways that they could help kids in the community,” Hunnicutt said. “We decided that we would work toward offering a tutoring program.”

  One-hundred and thirty families have signed up for the virtual tutoring through the School of Education’s Facebook page. Since so many families have signed up, it has taken time to match IU students and volunteers with the K-12 students and plan the logistics, Hunnicutt said.


  “We try to place based on whether they are interested in elementary or secondary,” Hunnicutt said.


  The IU student and staff volunteer tutors have a variety of backgrounds. They have been divided up into three tutor groups and matched with a K-12 student based on the students’ study needs.


  “The first 63 placements that we sent are early field experience students who are mostly going into education,” Hunnicutt said. “The next set of tutors will be taking one of their elementary literacy courses. Then, they are becoming elementary teachers. The rest of the placements will be volunteers from the School of Education.”


  Hunnicutt said all the college tutors are excited to get started and are thrilled to be giving back during a trying time in education.


  Taylor Belleville, a senior studying secondary English education, said she plans to move to Chicago after graduation and hopes to work in the Chicago Public School system in a ninth- or 10th-grade classroom.


  “I think that tutoring is definitely going to help me be a better teacher in the future,” Belleville said. “It is such an important skill to have, because in our future as educators, we will definitely have students who need individualized help.”

  The Avon, Indiana, native said she’s seen how much students are struggling with e-learning, because she has four younger siblings who are still in secondary school.


  She hopes programs like the free virtual tutoring will help bridge the gap so that when things go back to face-to-face classes, it’s not as hard to catch all of the students up on what they might have missed.


  “Teachers can’t do everything and commit 100 percent of their time to helping students, so hopefully having this program will take a little of the pressure back off of them,” Belleville said.


  Although registration for fall tutoring is closed because of the huge turnout, Hunnicutt said her goal is start up another virtual tutoring session next semester.


  “Helping kids is what I have always wanted to do as a teacher, so it’s really special to be able to get the program rolling,” Hunnicutt said.

IUPUI, Grand Park release results of study on youth sports amid COVID-19 pandemic







For Immediate Release

            Jun 3, 2020
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – The results of a new scientific survey of more than 10,000 people across 45 states provides insight into Americans’ perceptions and expectations around a return to youth sports amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.


  The survey was conducted as part of a collaborative research study between the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute and the Westfield-based Grand Park Research Hub, part of the Grand Park Sports Campus. Their findings were recently published in the Sports Innovation Journal.

  “As we look to see youth sports reactivate across America, it is critical that we understand the mindset and expectations of those intimately involved,” Westfield Mayor Andy Cook said. “To build confidence and ensure a safe return to sports, we need to know what is expected and how it aligns with health data.”


  “Grand Park is the largest youth sports facility in the United States. It makes sense that we, in partnership with the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute, lead in this research,” said William Knox, director of the Grand Park Sports Campus. “In some cases, as we open back up, facility investments may or may not be expected. The information we have gleaned from this research is critical to event operators and organizations to create meaningful opportunities for athletes and their families to participate in sports again.”


  Led by David Pierce, director of the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute and an associate professor of sports management in the School of Health and Human Sciences at IUPUI, the study assessed the feelings of parents, athletes, coaches, officials and administrators toward 12 adaptations being considered and implemented by venues for restarting youth sports programs.


  “COVID-19 has impacted all areas of life, and youth sports is no exception,” Pierce said. “Our study’s results provide youth sports facilities and event operators with data on how specific adaptations are received by stakeholders who are looking to return to youth sports in a timely but safe manner.”


  Among the study’s findings, participants identified seven critical or expected changes as youth sports emerge amid the pandemic:


Venues and events should invest heavily and visibly in sanitization of facilities, playing areas and equipment – before, during and after events.
  
Venue operators and event managers can feel confident that the recommendations provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Federation of State High School Associations to sanitize playing areas and equipment after each use will be well received and welcomed by users.
  
Promotion and monitoring of social-distancing guidelines should take place.
  
Personal contact between players should be limited.
  
Admission should be limited to those under age 65 with no underlying medical conditions.
  
It will be expected for users to complete a health and contact information questionnaire prior to entering venues in order for youth sports to return during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  


  The study also found that parents of recreational athletes viewed the adaptations in a more positive light and as a more necessary part of the youth sports experience than did parents of travel athletes. Travel sports parents demonstrated an increasing comfort level in traveling for competitions over the summer months, from 42 percent in May to 76 percent in August.


  The survey was distributed to 40 youth sports organizations, which circulated the survey to their members. A total of 10,359 people from 45 states and representing at least 13 different sports completed the entire survey. Nearly 92 percent of respondents were parents, but with the option to select multiple roles, coaches (25 percent), administrators (10 percent), athletes (9 percent) and officials (3 percent) were also represented. 


The full report is available on the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute’s website.

Backpack Blessings tackles food insecurity with weekend meals for Ellettsville students








            Nov 16, 2020
          









  Helping children has been a passion and way of life for an Indiana University Bloomington employee and his wife. Chuck Aikman, content systems leader for IU Digital Campus Studio, and Sharon Aikman, a registered nurse at IU Health, have been foster parents for 14 children and are in the process of adopting their fifth child.

  That love and care extend to children outside their home, too.


  The nonprofit food pantry they operate from their house provides meals to about 50 students at three schools in Ellettsville so they don’t go hungry over the weekend. They have operated Backpack Blessings for seven years, and they make weekly deliveries to Edgewood High School, Edgewood Junior High and Seven Oaks Classical School. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the deliveries have been no-contact drop-offs at the schools.


  “The idea is to provide two full meals and some snack food, and the hope is they get one full meal at home,” Chuck Aikman said. “Even if they don’t, there is enough food to sustain them during the weekend.”


  Each student receives:


Two servings of cereal.
  
Two additional breakfast items.
  
Two fruit cups.
  
A sleeve of crackers.
  
Two pudding cups.
  
Two main meals (chicken noodle soup, beef stew, ramen noodles, for example).
  
Two fun snacks (fruit snacks, beef sticks, for example).
  
Juice boxes.
  
Shelf-stable milk.
  


  The students and their families also receive special Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. Thanksgiving is a turkey with the trimmings, and Christmas is a ham with the trimmings.


  Backpack Blessings is the result of God opening their eyes to the need, the Aikmans said.

  Sharon Aikman was involved in a women’s Bible study of the book “Radical” in the spring of 2013 and said it challenged her to examine her life and think about needs that are overlooked every day. She said it reminded her of an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s TV show where she took backpacks of food to students in inner-city schools who faced food insecurity.


  Sharon said she talked to Chuck about providing food for local students in need, and he embraced the idea.


  “I was on board right away,” Chuck said. “We’ve always had a heart to be willing to help.”


  “Our heart is for children,” Sharon said.


  Sharon spoke to the superintendent for Richland-Bean Blossom Community School Corp. at the time and asked if any students needed help with meals over the weekend.


  “The superintendent said, ‘I have been praying for eight years that somebody would do this. There is an incredible need,’” Sharon said.


  Seven Oaks Classical School, a charter school, began receiving help from Backpack Blessings in 2019.


  The schools tell the Aikmans how many students need food, the Aikmans and volunteers organize the bags of food and make the deliveries, and teachers distribute the food. In seven years, Backpack Blessings has provided students with more than 50,000 meals, the Aikmans said.


  “It’s really been a phenomenal effort that started with five little church ladies,” Sharon said.

  The Aikmans do whatever is necessary to ensure that nutritious food arrives at the school, and they never have limited the number of families that receive assistance, Edgewood High School Principal Dirk Ackerman said.


  “The Backpack Blessings program is a tremendous opportunity for many of our neediest families,” Ackerman said. “Many of the students that benefit from the program would go weekends without nutritious meals.”


  Backpack Blessings receives food and monetary donations, as well as volunteer support, from the Monroe County community, in addition to the Aikmans’ contributions. Chuck said one goal is to secure 12 community partners each year who are willing to support with donations for one month each.


  Some IU employees who have supported Backpack Blessings with money or food said the Aikmans’ selflessness and compassion drive their effort to fight food insecurity among children.


  “The thing that most impresses me is they both work full-time jobs and have their own family to take care of,” said Jennifer Mitchner, adjunct and e-text coordinator in the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. “And this is not just a one-time annual event for them; this is a passion that they live and provide as an ongoing year-round lifestyle. And nothing of personal gain except the joy and satisfaction of bettering a child’s life.”


  Anna Lynch, group manager for eLearning Design and Services at IU, connected with Chuck Aikman through University Information Technology Services and discovered they both have a passion for service, although in different areas.


  “The Aikmans have put a tremendous amount of energy into making sure kids in Monroe County don’t go home for the weekend without enough to eat,” Lynch said. “I think a lot of us don’t realize how many families struggle to put enough food on the table. This isn’t just a far-away problem; it is really, truly happening to families that we all interact with in our community.”


  Lynch said she supports Backpack Blessings through networking and word-of-mouth promotion, introducing people to the food pantry as a resource and explaining its mission.


  “One thing we have seen at IU and locally is that almost everyone cares about food security,” she said. “Everyone wants to do their part once they hear about the need and the efforts. It’s distressing that the need is so great, but it’s inspiring that the effort to fill that need is so strong.”

IUPUI study inspires play about discrimination toward African American women in Central Indiana








            May 9, 2019

  Issues of discrimination experienced by African American women in Central Indiana are taking center stage – literally – as part of a collaborative project between an IUPUI researcher and an Indianapolis-based playwright.


  Sally Wasmuth, an assistant professor in the School of Health and Human Sciences, said she had been reading news and research studies that reported troubling statistics related to race and health care, suggesting biases held by health care workers could be contributing to negative health outcomes for African American women. She wanted to bring greater attention to health inequities faced by African American women in Indianapolis, so she partnered with Lauren Briggeman, the artistic director of a local theater company, to bring their stories to life.


  Wasmuth interviewed 10 African American women living in the Indianapolis area about discrimination they had experienced in different health care settings. Briggeman then took those interviews and wove them into a play that she wrote, directed and produced through Summit Performance Indianapolis, a local theater company focused on exploring the lives and experiences of women.


  The play, “Same Blood: Stories of Inequity from 10 Black Women Living in Central Indiana,” premiered May 7 at the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre in downtown Indianapolis. A second showing at the Phoenix Theatre will be free and open to the public at 7 p.m. May 14. After the performance, a short panel discussion will take place to talk about the play and answer questions from the audience.


  Indianapolis resident Sherry Harris, one of the 10 women interviewed by Wasmuth, said watching a play inspired by her experiences with discrimination was difficult, but she thinks talking about these problems more openly is a necessary step toward positive change.


  “I believe our community needs to hear this,” Harris said. “People want to turn around and say racism doesn’t exist. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want it to be a conversation. But it exists. I don’t know if it will ever change, but it exists.”

  Wasmuth said that although she had planned to focus the interviews on health care inequity, discrimination was so prevalent in the lives of the women she talked to that her focus expanded to inequities found in multiple aspects of their lives, such as shopping at the grocery store, checking in at a doctor’s office or attending classes at a university.


  “I think it’s important to highlight how vast the problem is,” Wasmuth said. “The thing that I was struck by was how often and how constant and how pervasive experiences of discrimination were.”


  For some women, discrimination affected where they were looking to receive health care or from whom they were seeking health care services, she said. Other women actually worked in the health care system, so they were able to talk about experiences of discrimination not only as a patient, but also as a colleague.


  Briggeman said she hopes hearing these women’s stories as part of a theatrical performance will help community members connect with their struggles on a more personal level.


  “I think theater is the greatest creator of empathy,” Briggeman said. “What’s exciting to me is the honesty of each individual’s story, just being able to step back and hear that.”


  Wasmuth said a goal of the project is to spark community conversation and action that leads to improved health outcomes for African American women in Indiana.


  “One of the best ways that we can start to reduce some of these problems in our society is by unveiling what’s happening,” Wasmuth said. “By coming to this play, people will really get firsthand perspectives about things happening in our community right now, in 2019.”


  This project was made possible by a nearly $25,000 Trailblazer Award from the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute’s Community Health Partnerships program. It is part of Wasmuth’s ongoing research on population health and the use of arts-based initiatives to promote occupational justice.

Civil rights activists Angela Davis and Alicia Garza to discuss social activism for MLK Day event







For Immediate Release

            Jan 6, 2021
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – As part of Indiana University’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration, the Madam Walker Legacy Center and the university will present “A Call to Action: Then and Now” from 4 to 6 p.m. Jan. 18.

  The virtual program will feature two of the nation’s most prolific civil rights activists: Angela Davis and Alicia Garza. They will discuss activism then and now for civil rights, social justice, inclusion and equality, offering pathways to build a world more reflective of King’s dream.


  “I am thrilled with this partnership and the opportunity to bring these two legendary activists together for a moderated dialogue answering questions about what has changed, what remains the same and the future of social justice in America,” said James C. Wimbush, IU vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs; dean of The University Graduate School; and Johnson Chair for Diversity and Leadership at Indiana University.


  The program will offer a first-time dialogue by the two internationally recognized leaders, who will discuss their social activism process, their experiences, and connecting generationally to current social justice and equality issues.


  Moderating the dialogue will be Angela Rye. A prominent political strategist offering on-air commentary, she also serves on boards of the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee and the Seattle University School of Law Alumni. Rye has served as Executive Director and General Counsel to the Congressional Black Caucus for the 112th Congress.


  Immediately following the panelist discussion, there will be a community conversation with local leaders. This conversation will highlight lessons learned and further discuss where we as a community go from here, regarding social justice and racial equity.


  Moderator for the community conversation will be Karen Vaughn with Radio One Indianapolis. Local panelists are:


David W. Greene, Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, President
  
Jessica Louise, Indy 10 Black Lives Matter Organizer
  
IPS Advisory Council Student
  
Lemuel Warren Watson, Indiana University
  


  Davis, a distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is the author of 10 books. A lecturer known for powerful speeches and dialogue about injustice, she has been involved in social justice movements worldwide.


  Garza is co-creator of #BlackLivesMatter and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which now has 40 chapters in four countries. She serves as the strategy and partnerships director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance and is co-founder of Supermajority, a new home for women’s activism. Her activism involves health issues, student services and rights, rights for domestic workers, ending police brutality, anti-racism, and violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people of color.


  “Combining efforts to host this event in honor of Dr. King speaks to the importance of organizations coming together to create partnerships that take them beyond the ordinary to create the extraordinary,” said Madam Walker Legacy Center board chair Joyce Q. Rogers. “This year’s MLK Day of Celebration shines a spotlight on decades of advocacy and activism in American history to move beyond injustice for some to justice for all. Esteemed beyond the timeline of their combined experiences, we are poised to receive a powerful message with solutions for change. When we ask ourselves ‘What has changed,’ this dialogue provides a stark reality that brings it all into focus.”


  To register or to learn more about this event, visit the Madam Walker Legacy Center website or IU’s MLK Celebration site.


  Other details about IU’s celebration are available on the MLK Celebration site, including a list of events on multiple campuses, details about how to share a video about how King’s legacy has inspired you, and a virtual toolkit to provide members of the community with at-home experiences surrounding the day, including examples of service opportunities.

            Oct 11, 2019
          









  More than 2,000 hours of audio and video field recordings of vocabulary, interviews and storytelling from indigenous people reside in the collection of the American Indian Studies Research Institute at Indiana University. Now, some of these recordings are being put to use to help one indigenous community reclaim its endangered language and culture.

  Anthropology faculty member and institute director Laura L. Scheiber recently received funding to continue work with the Assiniboine people of the Northern Great Plains of North America to strengthen their language, Nakoda, by creating instructional materials, dictionaries and storybooks for use in reservation schools and households. Many of these materials pull from stories recorded by IU faculty in the 1970s and 1980s.


  Founded in 1985 by IU anthropology professors Raymond DeMallie and Douglas Parks, the American Indian Studies Research Institute has a long history of interdisciplinary research projects that attempt to fully understand and describe the language, culture or history of the native people of the Americas. In 2007, the institute launched a partnership with the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, to create the first comprehensive Lakota language curriculum for K-12 schools.


  The success of these materials, coupled with decades of relationship-building and contact with the university, inspired leaders in the Assiniboine community to approach the institute about working together to create similar instructional materials for Nakoda. They hope that using the narratives told by tribe elders as the basis for the instructional materials will allow learners to not only reclaim the language but to more fully understand the Assiniboine worldview.

  “Euro-Western ideologies of languages often treat them as just codes with referential value – you use it to label the world,” said Richard Henne-Ochoa, interim acting director of the institute. “In contrast, indigenous ideologies of language emphasize the relational aspect of language: how you relate to other people, how you relate to the environment, how you relate to the cosmos. All of these stories reveal that.”


  Mike Turcotte and Tuffy Helgeson, teachers in two Assiniboine communities in Montana who have been responsible for raising funding and leading the past two years of the project, consult with the team at IU during every step of the process. Turcotte and Helgeson recently visited campus, members of the institute’s team traveled to Saskatchewan to meet some community members, and the partners are in frequent contact via email and phone.


  Beyond informing the team about what’s best for their community, Turcotte and Helgeson provide insights and cultural nuances that the institute’s staff members may overlook. For example, Helgeson explained that the Nakoda word for Sunday is literally “holy day.” He said Assiniboine people believe every day to be holy, and labeling Sunday as the only holy day in a week – or having a name for days of the week in general – reveals the impact of Western and Christian worldviews.


  Helgeson has been aware of IU’s work with his tribe since he was a young boy and faculty were visiting the reservation to work with his grandparents. At first, he said, many members of his community were skeptical of the visitors’ motivations. But after years of trust-building and partnership, Helgeson said the work being done by the university is revered as essential.


  “Just in my lifetime, I’ve gone from being fully immersed in my language to having very few people I’m able to speak to,” Helgeson said. “The work we are doing with IU is building a foundation for the next generation, including my son who is in second grade, to be able to be fully immersed like I once was.”


  Jon Bowman, director of the Center for the Documentation of Endangered Languages at IU, pointed out the care the institute is taking to ensure that its Assiniboine partners are determining what will be most useful for their community.


  “If we just come up with a curriculum without their consultation, then it’s just more colonizing; it’s just repeating the old crime,” he said. “When it’s through their own elders’ old stories, that’s where they can hopefully get an idea of a worldview that simply isn’t available otherwise.”


  The process for transforming the field recordings into instructional materials starts with Bowman, who digitizes the recordings of the Assiniboine elders in his center’s lab. Many of these recordings have been transcribed by hand by DeMallie, who worked closely with native Nakoda speakers to develop a writing system for the spoken-only language. Linguists take these transcriptions, along with vocabulary collected by DeMallie, and enter them into a computer database. When recordings that haven’t been transcribed are entered into the database, a literal translation is quickly produced.

  Linguists then work closely with native speakers to interpret the literal translations, correct errors and account for idioms. Once a revised translation is created, linguists work with curriculum developers to synthesize the recordings into stories that can be used to teach beginning language learners. Then curriculum developers build lessons and work with native artists to produce the textbooks and dictionaries, a difficult feat considering only a handful of native speakers remain to help with this process.


  The team hopes to have instructional material for students in kindergarten through fifth grade completed by the end of July 2020. Materials for kindergarten and first grade, along with a teacher’s manual, will be presented at a meeting of the Montana Indian Education Association in April. The team is also developing an educational app and hopes to create a Nakoda keyboard for smartphones so the community can text and communicate via Facebook Messenger in their native language.


  In addition to helping the Assiniboine people reclaim their language, IU has been repatriating culture by sharing recordings of songs in IU’s Archives of Traditional Music and sharing archival images of Assiniboine people from the early 1900s that are part of the collection at the Mathers Museum of World Cultures. Bowman said these materials have inspired members of the indigenous community to uncover old recordings, often in outdated formats, from their own basements and attics. Recently, he helped digitize one of these recordings made on a badly damaged record and uncovered seven lost songs.

  Curriculum developer Cynthia Ramlo said IU may be the only university that can work with the Assiniboine on a language project of this scope and impact, given its resources like the Archives of Traditional Music, the Mathers Museum and the American Indian Studies Research Institute, as well as decades of faculty connections and research with these communities and its strength in digitization.


  Henne-Ochoa said the institute hopes to continue building on the tradition of research and repatriation of indigenous culture by strengthening ties with people like the Assiniboine and creating new relationships with other tribes. Eventually, he said, the institute would like to work with other tribes to create instructional material for their languages and even create exchange programs for students and faculty at indigenous universities.


  “We are in an era where there’s strong potential for reconciliation,” Henne-Ochoa said. “If we listen to indigenous people and hear and appreciate that they have worldviews, indigenous epistemologies and knowledge systems, we can not only understand the human experience, we can enrich the human experience for everyone.”

  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – The Indiana University Center for Rural Engagement will connect rural residents with local and statewide health experts to share information about COVID-19 vaccines and answer questions. Rural Indiana’s Shot: A COVID-19 Vaccine Discussion will be a virtual panel discussion at 7 p.m. Feb. 25.


  Panelists joining the discussion include Dr. Yolanda Yoder, a physician at Southern Indiana Community Health Care; Dr. Lana Dbeibo, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the IU School of Medicine; Graham McKeen, assistant university director of public and environmental health at IU; and Dr. Lindsay Weaver, chief medical officer at the Indiana Department of Health. The discussion will be moderated by Katherine Pope, health liaison at the IU Center for Rural Engagement.


  “COVID-19 has turned our lives upside down, and the virus’s impacts have rippled across our state, from individual and public health crises and local business challenges to education disruption,” said Kerry Thomson, executive director of the IU Center for Rural Engagement.


  “With the development and distribution of vaccines for the novel coronavirus, residents have questions about how the vaccine will affect their personal and family’s health as well as activities in their communities,” Thomson said. “This event offers an opportunity to elevate and address those questions.”


  Panelists will share information about the science behind the vaccines and their development, the role the vaccines play in getting back to normal, the vaccines’ side effects and other medical information to consider, and insights regarding rural Indiana’s access to the vaccines.


  Hosted as a webinar via the Zoom platform, the event will give attendees the opportunity to ask questions in advance as well as during the live program. The program will also be broadcast via Facebook Live on the IU Center for Rural Engagement’s Facebook page.


  Registration and more information about the event are available on the event’s calendar listing.

First-of-its-kind online tool helps Indiana communities address climate change vulnerabilities


            Hoosier Resilience Index provides localized data for every community in the state
          






For Immediate Release

            Nov 12, 2019
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, part of the Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative, has launched the Hoosier Resilience Index, a first-of-its-kind online tool to help local governments and Indiana residents understand how their communities are vulnerable to climate change and what they can do to respond.

  Drawing from publicly available datasets, the index places community-specific information at the fingertips of local leaders, providing data for every town, city and county in the state. The data include information about extreme heat and precipitation projections, flood plain and land use maps, and demographic information of vulnerable neighborhoods.


  The index helps local governments assess their readiness for environmental change and track community progress. By filling out a questionnaire, communities can score themselves and identify areas where they can work toward greater resilience.


  “Every Indiana community is facing challenges as a result of the environmental changes that are happening,” said Janet McCabe, director of the Environmental Resilience Institute. “Across the state, we will be seeing more days of extreme heat, heavy rain and flooding, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with these impacts. The Hoosier Resilience Index puts local governments in control of their community’s future – not only showing every town, city and county the challenges they are likely to face in the years ahead, but also supplying a framework to help local officials assess community preparedness, prioritize the most important actions and make a plan.”


  Scientific evidence shows that the climate is changing in the Midwest, with average temperatures expected to increase by 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and precipitation becoming heavier and more damaging in the winter and spring (and less frequent in the summer and fall). Most rural towns and small- to mid-sized cities do not have access to experts who can help them understand the direct implications of these changes, such as impacts to the local economy, housing and public health.


  The index draws from a wide range of federal and state datasets – including information supplied by the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency – to help communities plan for these risks. It is the first state-specific tool to package climate change information for local governments in this way.


  “One of the critical roles of municipal government is comprehensive and long-term planning,” said Matt Greller, CEO of Accelerate Indiana Municipalities. “I don’t think cities and towns in Indiana have ever had a tool like the Hoosier Resilience Index to look at environmental factors as an overlay into that planning process.”


  To design the index, the Environmental Resilience Institute consulted local officials across the state and worked with four “beta testing” communities. Local officials from less populous towns and counties, who sometimes struggle to find data relevant to their communities, were especially receptive to the index.


  “One of the strengths of the Hoosier Resilience Index is the fact that it is data based on my community,” said Denny Spinner, mayor of Huntingburg, a town of about 6,000 in southern Indiana. “There’s tremendous value in that, and I think that’s something that mayors across the state are really looking for.”


  To learn more about the Hoosier Resilience Index, register to attend webinars on Nov. 13 and Dec. 2.


  What they’re saying


  “As our environment changes and our relationship to it evolves, we know that we have to be ready. By both learning about how the environment is changing and examining our plans for these drastic changes, Noble County is actively preparing for change. The index is going to help us examine our plans and determine next steps based on our risk. Local governments across the state have been working on strengthening infrastructure and building more resiliently, and this tool helps provide support for these efforts.” – Kenneth Hughes, plan director of Noble County, Indiana


  “I think the tool will be a useful index for Hoosier communities and could be a model for other states to follow. The assessment questions forced us to look at the impacts so many of our local policies have on the environment around us, and the questions themselves helped us identify areas where we need to be better prepared for the impacts of climate change on our community.” – Jonathan Leist, town manager of Culver, Indiana


  “The Hoosier Resilience Index makes public data easier for community leaders to assemble and examine and provides a remarkable suite of information that is relevant to all of a community’s planning needs for anticipated climate change impacts. It will be an obvious springboard for action.” – Michael Hamburger, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, IU Bloomington


  Prepared for Environmental Change


  The Indiana University Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative brings together a broad, bipartisan coalition of government, business, nonprofit and community leaders to help Indiana better prepare for the challenges that environmental changes bring to our economy, health and livelihood. Announced in May 2017, Prepared for Environmental Change is working to deliver tailored and actionable solutions to communities across the state of Indiana.

IUPUI chemistry graduate student recognized for volunteerism


            Christine Skaggs led efforts to distribute ‘COVID-19 chemistry kits’ to more than 200 underserved children in Indianapolis

  Christine Skaggs, a graduate student in chemistry at the School of Science at IUPUI, was recently named the Global Outreach Volunteer of the Year by the American Chemical Society, or ACS.


  The honor, which recognizes “the immeasurable efforts made by volunteers from ACS local sections and international chapters to conduct outreach and teach the public about chemistry,” cites Skaggs’ work as the secretary of the Indianapolis section of ACS as well as her work as chair of COVID-19 Chemistry Kits for Kids, which distributed resource kits including masks, hand sanitizers and winter accessories to more than 200 students from underserved populations in Indianapolis.


  Of the 36 outreach volunteer awardees this year, Skaggs was the only individual selected for the special honor of ACS Global Outreach Volunteer of the Year.


  “ACS allows me to bridge my two passions, which are chemistry and outreach,” Skaggs said. “We want to be able to provide resources to those who need them, and it’s very rewarding to be able to give back, even if it’s in a small way.”


  COVID-19 Chemistry Kits for Kids was conducted in partnership with the American Chemical Society; Asphalt Materials; the Bruker Corporation; Butler University; Corteva Inc.; Eli Lilly and Co; The Heritage Research Group; Hotel Tango; IUPUI; the IUPUI Graduate Student Chemistry Society, MOLE; the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers; and the University of Indianapolis. Skaggs worked with Linda Osborn, a senior project chemist at the Heritage Research Group, to coordinate contributions from these organizations across the city.

  The kits contained reusable, custom-sized masks; hand sanitizer; snacks; activity booklets with crayons; a hand-washing demo; hats and gloves; a folder with resources on COVID-19 for parents; water bottles; Post-It notes; pencils; keychains; stress balls; goggles; and soap.


  Assembly took place over the course of two days in July at the Science Building on the IUPUI campus. School of Science graduate students Courtney Cruse, Kymeri Davis, Mikayla Metzger, Lauren Mehok, Ashur Rael, Carolina Vega and Hannah Zimmerman were among the volunteers.


  The kits were then transported to Heritage Research Group, a privately held, family-owned environmental services business located near Eagle Creek in northwest Indianapolis, whose volunteers distributed the kits in the community in October.


  The overall response from the community was overwhelming, and we were able to double the number of kits we assembled due to the support from our sponsors,” Skaggs said. “The encouragement this project was given made me proud to call Indianapolis my home; I wanted to give back to a city that has given so much to me.”


  Skaggs is also the founder of ACS Indiana’s Senior Chemists Mentorship Program, which connects senior chemists with younger scientists, and she has been actively involved in the annual Celebrate Science Indiana festival.


  The full list of awardees is published in Chemical and Engineering News. Winners were also recognized during the annual ChemLuminary Awards ceremony, which took place virtually Dec. 9.

Virtual summer program provides IT training to Indianapolis youth


            IUPUI’s Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce program has launched summer program providing educational opportunities during pandemic
          







            Jul 8, 2020
          









  Although many summer activities are canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a newly launched initiative from IUPUI’s award-winning IT workforce development program is providing 625 local high school students in underrepresented minorities the opportunity to participate in STEM-related workshops and trainings through a virtual format.

  Established in 2015 by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce, or iDEW, program has launched the AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program.
   
  This year’s activities, which run through Aug. 1, include Scrum training/project management certification, Code Black Indy-Salesforce project build-out training, Black Data Processing Associates-iDEW mentorship and a customized “speaking college,” as well as a virtual workshop in game and creature design taught by school faculty. In addition, students will be guided by trained IUPUI student mentors, who will encourage and support them along the way.
   
  iDEW provides free computing by design (CxD) support and instruction to students from eight area high schools – Pike, Providence Cristo Rey, Arsenal Technical, Herron, George Washington, Riverside, McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology, and Southport – and has reached more than 1,680 students through its curriculum. The program, which recently completed its fifth year, has graduated 492 students, and over 90 percent are now attending college, 80 percent in STEM-related majors.
   
  Beyond completing learning modules in robotics, Internet of Things, trivia apps, chatbots/artificial intelligence, and video game design and data visualization, iDEW students are offered internship opportunities, visit IT industries, receive SAT prep assistance, and attend summer workshops and national IT conferences. In addition to building coding skills, students develop confidence and learn teamwork and communication.
   
  The AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program is made possible by a $50,000 grant from the AT&T Foundation and will fund students’ participation in these summer technology workshops and trainings.
   
  “We are proud to support programs like IUPUI’s iDEW that are helping people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds build the skills they need for successful careers in STEM fields,” said Bill Soards, president of AT&T Indiana. “The high school students participating in the program will become the future workers who help our world stay connected when we aren’t able to be together in person.”
   
  The summer program is also supported by a $10,000 grant from the Donaldson Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Donaldson Filtration Solutions, which has manufacturing or distribution sites in Anderson, Frankfort and Rensselaer.

  “We are excited and honored to contribute to the success of the iDEW program,” said Chini Zeman, a Donaldson Foundation board member. “Donaldson has a strong footprint in the greater Indianapolis community, and this program allows us to help support our community while aligning perfectly with our core charter of supporting educational opportunities for those who otherwise might not have them.”
   
  “We have grown the iDEW program in size and scope over the last five years,” added Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and program director for iDEW. “These grants give us needed resources to fund this unique opportunity to benefit underserved youth in the Indianapolis community during the summer months as well.”

$1.7M grant to pilot AI student education for rural Indiana middle schoolers







For Immediate Release

  CRANE, Ind. – Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, and Indiana University were awarded $1.7 million to collaborate on artificial intelligence programming for rural middle school students. The Office of the Secretary of Defense funded the AI pilot program, which will begin this summer.


NSWC Crane is teaming up with two IU schools: the School of Education and the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, both at IU Bloomington. NSWC Crane and IU received the National Defense Education Program Award to pilot the program, titled AI Goes Rural: Middle School Artificial Intelligence Education, to Indiana middle schools.


  Tina Closser, the science, technology, engineering and math program coordinator for NSWC Crane, said the program will focus on how AI is involved in students’ lives and the ethics surrounding AI.


  “The expertise that IU is bringing to the AI Goes Rural program is exciting, and we are thrilled to have them as a partner to bring this curriculum to regional students,” Closser said. “People, including kids, think AI is alien and science fiction. They don’t realize how it is already integrated into their lives.


  “AI is a hot topic right now, and it is more than Netflix and Spotify curating movies or music for the user. This pilot program is unique; I’ve never seen anything like this. There’s a lot out there about the technical side of AI and how it works, but we will be talking about what AI does and how it affects their lives.”


  Jeff Zaleski, interim vice provost for research at IU Bloomington, said he is pleased that IU is continuing its strong partnership with NSWC Crane.


  “The involvement of the faculty from two of our schools points to IU Bloomington’s deep strengths in areas related to artificial intelligence, and the application of this expertise to the lives of rural Hoosier students is especially exciting,” Zaleski said. “To pilot this program, many letters of support were received from across the Department of Defense, including the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. The letters make note of the critical importance of developing the AI talent pipeline.


Raj Acharya, associate vice president for research for AI innovation at IU, said the AI Goes Rural curriculum is designed to help students understand what AI can and cannot do.


  “We will educate students on AI and machine-learning techniques by designing modules that students will experiment with under varying conditions,” Acharya said. “This will help them understand not only the potential of routine AI methodologies used, but also their limitations such as bias and ethical considerations.”


  Closser said the curriculum and training are intended to be scalable across the nation, with broad applications.


  “We wanted to create something that anyone around the country can implement, copy and paste,” she said.


  A report from the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council said that investing in STEM education and outreach is critical for several reasons: The demand for STEM professionals will exceed the expected supply over the next decade; our nation’s students are “‘middle of the pack”’ when evaluated against other countries; and participation and achievement of underrepresented groups such as women and minorities are lower than desired.


  The STEM talent pipeline is part of the Department of Defense’s STEM Strategic Plan and includes promoting an “increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.” Closser said this and several other factors led to the development of this program.


  “As our STEM team and IU were in the brainstorming process, we considered the rural, underserved area,” Closser said. “There’s a large percentage of students that attend Title I schools in the area, or schools that under the Department of Education have high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families.


  “We have talented people in the area, but the number seeking STEM degrees isn’t high. We have an opportunity through this program and programs like this to show kids what options they have and what they can do as a career.”


  The AI Goes Rural team members include Closser and Alison Smith of NSWC Crane; Kyungbin Kwon, Anne Leftwich and Krista Glazewski of the IU School of Education; and Acharya and Mehmet Dalkilic of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering.

School of Education at IUPUI helping Central Indiana educators with virtual teaching strategies








            Jul 30, 2020
          









  One of the biggest questions of this pandemic summer is how K-12 schools will resume teaching in the fall, with one answer being a continuation of virtual classes that launched in the spring.


  Four months ago, teachers were thrust into an online-instruction world with little training or preparation. With time a bit more on their side now, school leaders and teachers have a chance to discuss and strategize what online learning could look like in the fall semester – and the School of Education at IUPUI is helping to facilitate those conversations.

  A team of faculty and staff held “virtual sharing sessions” with administrators and teachers from a number of Central Indiana school districts, discussing experiences with remote learning in the spring alongside concerns and plans for similar instruction in the fall.


  “What we really want to do is help the schools think through this – you can’t just take the classroom and put it online and expect it to work,” said Jeremy Price, an assistant professor in the School of Education specializing in urban education and technology in education. “This is a context-based, community-based approach.”


  The School of Education’s efforts will be enhanced by a $1,179,000 grant from the Indiana Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund to support educators and families through remote learning.


  The team, which includes Price, clinical associate professor Paula Magee, assistant professor Cristina Santamaria Graff, and marketing and communications coordinator Javier Barrera from IUPUI, plus associate professor Ted Hall of Martin University, identified five areas in which they can help educators strategize:


Strengthening instructional practices during remote learning – that is, the content and goals of the instruction and how to transform it to the online setting.
  
Providing digital learning resources and engagement strategies for families.
  
Building administrative capacity.
  
Supporting educator self-care, as traditional boundaries between work and home have been blurred by holding virtual classes.
  
Preparing remote-ready future teachers in the event of future pandemics or catastrophes.
  


  “There’s a need for some external support as well as integrating technology into teaching,” Hall said. “It’s important to have teachers from a conceptual standpoint make the transition from face-to-face instruction to online while still being able to employ pedagogical strategies.”


  The team plans more sessions before school begins and is applying for grants through the Indiana Governor’s Emergency Education Relief – or GEER – fund, a component of the CARES Act, to further support the mission.

$1.59 million grant funds computer science workshops to train public school teachers







For Immediate Release

            May 24, 2021
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – The IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI is using a two-year, $1.59 million grant from the Indiana Department of Education to offer a variety of free workshops to train Indiana public high school and middle school teachers who are passionate about expanding computer science in the classroom.

  The summer Computing by Design Teachers Training Program is being offered to more than 300 Indiana educators over the next two summers. Starting this fall, Indiana law will require computer science coursework to be offered in all Indiana schools.


  “Having computer science taught across grade levels and schools provides Hoosier students greater access to this growing, problem-solving field,” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said. “As schools across the state have expanded their computer science offerings, partners like the IU School of Informatics and Computing have played an important role in training our educators to prepare our students with the skills and knowledge needed for the future.”


  The Computing by Design program, launched in 2019, prepares teachers to be able to offer computer science classes at their schools. Last summer, the first year the workshops were offered, 112 teachers participated.


  “The need for professional development in computer science continues to rise quickly,” said Jim Lyst, a School of Informatics and Computing faculty member and curriculum lead of the Computing by Design program. “At the same time, the unique context for every teacher and school demands an adaptable pathway to preparing successful coursework. This year, we are offering several workshop options for teachers to choose from, regardless of their background and experience in computer science.”


  Computing by Design, also known as CxD, is a professional development experience for teachers in all instructional areas who are expected to teach courses or offer activities in computer science. The program curriculum has been successfully implemented through the school’s popular Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program, now running in eight high schools. Participants will be taught by School of Informatics and Computing faculty, focused on developing lesson plans in computer science that follow a Computing by Design-based teaching and learning format.


  “The key innovation and the tremendous success of the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program has been developing and implementing the CxD curriculum in teaching computing concepts in high school computer science classes,” said Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing. “This approach instilled interest – specifically in IT, and in STEM broadly – among high school students. We are excited that the IDOE has recognized the CxD approach as being a successful model to adopt and expand to school teachers in Indiana who are engaged in teaching computer science classes.”


  Offerings include:


Six programming workshops (trivia, chatbot, robot, video game, internet of things and data visualization).
  
An innovation workshop.
  
A project-based-learning 101 workshop.
  
Six cross-discipline workshops with projects that blend computer science into business, language arts, math, art and more.
  


  While the workshops will be largely conducted online, allowing for greater flexibility of time, regular live Zoom meetings will be scheduled and materials, including videos, will remain available after the workshops for further self-guided review. Teachers will have access to School of Informatics and Computing faculty for remote technical assistance during the training and throughout the academic year using a web-based workspace.


  In addition, standalone computer science activities for all grades, but with an emphasis on kindergarten through Grade 8, will be developed during the summer and through next year and made available online.

Impact of community diversity on economic development is focus of IUPUC event


            “Lead by Design: Unveiling the Bias” is third in a series of community roundtables
          







            Oct 12, 2020
          









  The IUPUC Center for Business and Economic Development will host Columbus-area residents in an Oct. 13 discussion about how bias, equity, diversity and inclusion fuel economic development.


  The free, virtual “Lead by Design: Unveiling the Bias” invites people in the Columbus area to engage on local issues. The event will include a keynote address by Mark Stewart, president of United Way of Bartholomew County. There also will be breakout conversations following presentations by Julie Goodspeed-Chadwick, IUPUC Chancellor’s Professor of English; Kevin Jones, IUPUC associate professor of management; and Marsha VanNahmen, assistant director of the IUPUC Center for Teaching and Learning.


  Melissa Fairbanks, director of the IUPUC Center for Business and Economic Development, said community members will have the opportunity to speak with one another on issues of diversity, inclusion and economic development rather than be fed information.

  “After each of the three presentations, attendees will participate in breakout sessions to discuss key points and to interact with one another,” Fairbanks said.


  “Research has proven that diversity, equity and inclusion create more community engagement and higher productivity. Many studies have shown that when a diverse group of people makes decisions, the results are better and have a more far-reaching impact.”


  “Lead by Design: Unveiling the Bias” is partially sponsored by the Indiana University Council for Regional Engagement and Economic Development, which granted $2,500 from its Regional Economic Development Fund.


  What they’re saying


  The event speakers shared a brief summary of their presentations for the event.


  “In considering and adhering to feminist principles, we will be open to diversity and inclusion and be aware of – and continue to strive toward recognizing so we can mitigate – bias. A feminist workplace establishes a culture in which people feel valued and that they belong, and one in which we can attract and retain diverse people and ideas. We build and sustain a community when people feel heard and valued, and results show that people work harder and organizations are more successful when they attract and retain diversity in all its richness.” – Julie Goodspeed-Chadwick


  “I will present a process to help participants move forward with ideas to understand and manage unconscious bias. I’ll present four questions from the “design thinking” approach of Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie to challenge participants to create actionable approaches to reduce the adverse impact of unconscious bias.” – Kevin Jones


  “Population growth is important to economic growth, and a significant percentage of Bartholomew County’s population growth over the past decade has come from people of color. Bartholomew County has room for improvement to retain people of color and continue to attract them. Many civic organizations in Bartholomew County – including not-for-profits and local government commissions – do not reflect the demographic makeup of our community. Women and people of colors are often underrepresented.” – Mark Stewart


  “We all have unconscious or implicit bias. Implicit bias can influence our decision-making in ways we don’t even realize. Knowing this, we can integrate measures to neutralize our biases before they translate into behavior and minimize the negative impact within our organizations.” – Marsha VanNahmen

Social work students answer the call as frontline telephone crisis workers during pandemic








            May 27, 2021
          









  Indiana 211, a free service that connects Hoosiers with local resources 24/7, had been fielding an average of 20,000 calls a month in early 2020.

  But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., that number quickly jumped to 20,000 calls a day from people seeking coronavirus-related information and help with lost wages, evictions, food insecurity and other challenges stemming from the pandemic.


  Almost immediately after this unprecedented rise, Indiana University School of Social Work students were on the frontlines. Starting in March 2020, 29 students from the school – 28 pursuing a master’s degree in social work and one pursuing a bachelor’s degree – have worked at Indiana 211 as part of the practicum requirement for their degrees.


  “It’s easy to forget, but Indiana 211 was a first responder to the pandemic in Indiana, before we even understood the disease or if there was hope for a vaccine,” said Erika Galyean, an associate clinical professor for the Master of Social Work program at the IU School of Social Work, who arranged for students to serve at Indiana 211.


  “Every time there was a new announcement about changes in local laws or public health practices – such as social distancing, masking, getting a test, or even whether it was safe to go to work – the state would direct people to 211,” said Galyean, who also provided field instruction to the participating students. “They were getting hundreds upon hundreds of calls from employers and citizens, nearly overnight.”


  IU’s partner on the collaboration is Jaimie Ferren, deputy director of Indiana 211 at the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration. She and Galyean knew each other through Galyean’s role as a member of the state’s Resiliency and Emotional Support Team, a volunteer team that provides mental health support to first responders in crisis and disaster events, including workers at Indiana 211. After an initial conversation, Galyean said it became clear the IU School of Social Work was in a position to help address the sudden shortage in telephone crisis workers needed to serve the huge increase in callers.


  The partnership was also beneficial to students, many of whom had abruptly lost their social work field placements due to the pandemic. Such placements are a requirement for degree completion, but thanks to the Indiana 211 partnership, no student who accepted an alternate placement with 211 had to extend their graduation date. Moreover, since the call-center work occurred remotely, MSW students from four IU campuses – IUPUI, IU Bloomington, IU Northwest and IU South Bend – as well as students in the MSW Direct online program, were able to participate.

  “Indiana 211 crisis calls challenged me daily,” said Ashley Asante-Doyle, an MSW Direct student who worked at the service until the end of last year. “Hearing some of the stories broke my heart; I had some disgruntled callers and some emergencies … but overall, the experience was awesome. I decided to pursue a career in social work to help others, and working at Indiana 211 allowed me the opportunity to assist.”


  In addition to questions about COVID-19 tests and mask wearing, Asante-Doyle said she fielded questions about food insecurity; the federal eviction moratorium; assistance with car payments and monthly utilities; shelter; mental health services; and requests to be placed in a facility to quarantine.


  Students working with the call center choose a time to log in between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., with shifts running four hours. Calls start immediately, running back to back. During a typical shift, Ferren said a person could handle about 25 calls.


  “Indiana 211 really is vital to the state of Indiana,” Asante-Doyle said. “Without it, Hoosier families wouldn’t be able to access resources to carry them over or assist during an emergency. It’s also a great opportunity for organizations to get their resources into the community.”


  In addition to the IU School of Social Work, Ferren said Indiana 211 received support from other local nonprofit and government agencies, as well as contact tracing staff from the Indiana Department of Health.


  To coordinate during calls, Asante-Doyle would communicate with fellow workers through an online group chat. Indiana 211 also split students between various service lines focused on specific topics. MSW students most commonly worked lines for COVID-19 inquiries, such as clarifications about public restrictions and later vaccine access, as well as a line for rental assistance.


  To supplement the students’ field experience, Galyean incorporated topics relevant to their Indiana 211 work into the classroom, such as discussions and readings on crisis intervention work, as well as practicing coping skills to combat “compassion fatigue.” Students were also asked to identify journal articles on crisis intervention topics and compare the research to their own experiences.


  “I loved working with the students from the IU School of Social Work,” Ferren said. “They were all eager for new experiences and knowledge, and provided great insight and feedback, which we’ve been able to incorporate into our work.”


  Among other things, Galyean said students conducted an employee survey on inclusivity and diversity, which resulted in recommendations to improve training on these topics. Another group conducted a “customer satisfaction survey,” following up with people who were helped by the call center.


  But Asante-Doyle said that what stood out the most for her was supervisors’ willingness to provide constructive feedback, as well as the faculty’s willingness to listen to students about their experiences. She also said she and her fellow students stayed in contact outside practicum hours to provide feedback or encouraging words.


  Although no IU students are currently answering calls at Indiana 211 during the summer sessions, Galyean said the partnership has been so successful that Indiana 211 will become a permanent practicum site for IU, with MSW students returning for fall practicum placements in August.

IU, rural communities launch Community Engagement to End Child Sexual Exploitation







For Immediate Release

            Dec 14, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Rural communities working to protect local children now have resources from Indiana University to fight sexual exploitation and human trafficking. The Community Engagement to End Child Sexual Exploitation initiative connects IU faculty with state and local officials to address sex crimes against children.

  The IU Center for Rural Engagement, Eli Konwest and Teresa Nichols in the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies’ Center for the Study of Global Change, and Deb Getz in the School of Public Health-Bloomington are partnering with Brown, Greene and Putnam counties to build multidisciplinary alliances, assess local assets, develop action plans and address specific community needs. Using evidence-based training and convening local, state, regional and national resources, this initiative will create coordinated, well-informed and well-equipped local teams in rural communities.


  Human trafficking and online child exploitation are difficult to measure in existing data sets, and Indiana does not currently have an inclusive state-level system for tracking this information. The Community Engagement to End Child Sexual Exploitation initiative will collect and examine data that will support local and state law enforcement’s analysis of these crimes.


  “As youth learn more about their immediate environment and learn that not everyone is living in a safe place, they become alarmed, with a desire to make things safer,” said Malea Huffman, extension educator for 4-H Youth Development in Greene County. “Our youth have incredible will and energy. The CEECSE project will help us better understand the current resources and needs to serve these youth and all within our community. Utilizing that needs assessment data to make our communities safe for all is a win-win.”

  Human sex trafficking of children is defined as “a commercial sex act induced by force, fraud or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.” Reported cases of human trafficking increased 84 percent in Indiana between 2015 and 2017. According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, Indiana had 157 cases reported in 2019.


  Online child exploitation most commonly includes grooming, live streaming, possession, dissemination and production of child sexual exploitation imagery, and coercing and blackmailing children for sexual purposes.


  IU faculty and students will collaborate with the Alliance for Freedom, Restoration and Justice, a nonprofit humanitarian aid organization focused on supporting justice advocates and ending human trafficking, using the Engage Together Community Engagement Toolkit and accessible database. In combination with two training modules hosted by IU’s Public Health and You platform and a thought leader summit, the project will create a replicable model for other rural communities to implement in their own efforts.


  “Indiana’s children and their well-being are paramount, and we are committed to supporting community efforts to keep Hoosier children safe,” said Kerry Thomson, executive director of the Center for Rural Engagement. “With a multidisciplinary team at IU and dedicated local leaders and residents, we will strengthen safeguards and preventive measures that assist communities in ending abuse locally and across the state.”

Digital timeline tracks ‘Making and Unmaking of Black Wealth’ to aid racial justice conversations








            Mar 23, 2022
          









  Racial justice issues that sparked national conversations led Indiana University librarians and students to create an open-access digital resource that furthers education and dialogue with eye-opening information about the history of violent actions and discriminatory policies that have targeted Black wealth.





      This photo of The Black Market in Bloomington, Indiana, which was firebombed on Dec. 26, 1968, is an example of the historical information found on the interactive digital timeline that explores “The Making and Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States.”Photo courtesy of IU Archives
    



  ”Land, Wealth, Liberation: The Making and Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States” is an interactive timeline with photos, videos, historical information and resources for educators covering 1820 to 2020. The project explores the ways African Americans in the U.S. have produced wealth, and the factors that have affected their ability to build and maintain wealth and access economic opportunities.


  To launch the digital timeline, IU Libraries, IU’s Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society at Indiana University will host a roundtable conversation at 6 p.m. March 24 at the Lilly Library.


  The event will feature two speakers. Valerie Grim, professor of African American and African Diaspora studies in the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington, will present on “Struggles in Building Black Wealth.” Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, a scholar, activist and author who will give the 2022 Branigin Lecture for the Institute for Advanced Study, will speak about “Race and Gender in the Economy.” Registration is required to attend, and a virtual option is available.


  A pop-up exhibit will open at 5 p.m. March 24 and run for the duration of the event. Registration is not required for the pop-up exhibit.


Willa Tavernier, IU Libraries’ research impact and open scholarship librarian, said the national dialogue in 2020 around racial justice after several high-profile killings, and disparities such as the wealth gap and social class, sparked the idea for the project, which she and other IU librarians have led for more than a year.


  “A lot of people didn’t understand the origin of the wealth gap,” she said. “I would say even at the beginning of the project, even my understanding of it did not stack up to what I found. Historically, there has been so much destruction and targeting of Black communities and wealth that’s more widespread than I realized.”


  Tavernier said she wanted to create a widely relatable exhibit that sparks discussion and brings history to light in a freely accessible way. Because she wanted scholarly sources to be the basis of the information, she sought assistance from several librarians in early 2021: DeLoice Holliday, multicultural outreach librarian and head of the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Library; Ursula Romero, Lilly Library public services librarian; and Christina Jones, head of the Education Library.

  Holliday provided information about Black Wall Street communities and material on Black wealth. Romero assisted with unique primary sources from the Lilly Library. Jones and student employees at the Education Library created lesson plans that could be used by educators outside IU.


  “It is very important to educate others of the various places around the country that were destroyed by bands of violent people who used intimidation, trickery, fraud and, in many cases, eminent domain to upend Black communities around the country,” Holliday said.


  The 200-year timeline is broken into five time periods, starting with the pre-Civil War era, and each illustrates the forces and policies at work in those periods. Included are events such as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma, when about 300 people were killed and 35 city blocks burned, and actions and policies that hampered Black Americans’ ability to own land or homes.


  Undergraduate and graduate students were hired to help the librarians research and write for the digital exhibit. Working on the project was an eye-opening experience.


  Savannah Price, a history and gender studies major from Kentucky, worked on the technology platform’s accessibility. She went through the Associated Press report “Torn from the Land” and organized material about how land was taken away from African Americans. She said some of the things she learned have been “a lot to reckon with.”


  “One part of it that really stood out to me was seeing names of towns that my friends are from, where Black people were systemically run out of those towns in Kentucky,” Price said. “There was one town that was flooded to form Kentucky Lake, so the town’s entire history is under water. I didn’t know there were white people in that town who made sure there were no Black people in the whole county. They would give them a warning to leave and then burn down their houses if they didn’t.”


  Rihona Bing-English, a master’s student in the School of Social Work, examined the history of reparations and the first and second Morrill Acts that created land-grant universities. Learning this history, which she helped add to the timeline, has been difficult and at times hurtful, Bing-English said.


  “Growing up in Bloomington, Indiana, a predominantly white community, I had zero information on these policies and history,” she said. “I’m finding out about this now and processing it as an adult.”


  MarQuis Bullock, who is pursuing a master’s in library science with a specialization in archives and records management, worked with Tavernier on much of the initial research to determine what to include in the exhibit. He said growing up in Little Rock, Arkansas, there was a conscious effort at his school to make sure Black children knew Black history, but reading some of the documents during his project research still made for some tough moments.


  “You think about what the past could have been and the future could have been if there had not been civilian and political obstruction preventing African Americans from gaining economic, financial and social independence,” Bullock said. “You couldn’t help but to think where we could have been as a society in general had we been allowed to contribute equally to the construction of not just wealth, but the country’s wealth, and the country’s health as well.”


  Tavernier said she hopes the launch of the “Land, Wealth, Liberation” project is just a first step, and that IU faculty will see it as an opportunity to present research and information on related topics.


  “Our hope is this won’t be a static exhibit, but that faculty at IU with an interest in an area can build on the content,” she said.


  “The impact will probably be realized in the ways faculty, students and researchers use the resource,” Holliday added.

To address risks of lead in water, IUPUI researchers partner with faith organizations


            Two campus institutions collaborate with Indianapolis Ministerium to provide free resources to communities at greatest risk of harm from lead

  A partnership between IUPUI researchers and faith organizations in Indianapolis is taking aim at the risk of household lead contamination by providing residents the tools they need to protect against it.


  As a part of the Center for Urban Health at IUPUI’s long-term effort to map lead levels across the city, organizers with the Indianapolis Ministerium’s Faith Lead Initiative have begun to distribute lead test kits to residents on the near northwest side. The kits will provide participants with free, reliable lab results on potential lead exposure in their homes – information that is often out of reach due to barriers such as cost and lack of education on the risks of lead.


  The tests’ results will also contribute to anonymous public data on household lead levels across Indianapolis through the center’s Map My Environment website. This is the first time the website will contain data on lead levels in water.


  “There are regulations about the allowable amount of lead in water, but the truth is there’s no safe level of lead,” said Gabriel Filippelli, director of the Center for Urban Health and a Chancellor’s Professor at the School of Science at IUPUI. Filippelli’s expertise played a major role in a 2020 report on childhood lead poisoning from the Indiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “It’s a neurotoxin that permanently impairs the brain, and you can see markedly lower IQ and higher ADD/ADHD in children who are lead poisoned.”


  The risks of exposure are especially serious in infants and toddlers. Also, “it’s been consistently found that lead testing rates are significantly lower in communities of color, even as the poisoning rate are significantly higher,” he said.

  In response to these inequities, the center’s testing effort will focus on homes in downtown Indianapolis between Kessler Boulevard and Meridian Street, from 16th to 38th streets. A second, larger phase of the project – open to residents across the state – is planned this summer.


  Also a leader on the project is the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute, whose partnership with the Ministerium began under the Anthropocene Household Project, an oral history project whose subject is residents of the city’s near northwest side.


  On April 8, volunteers at First Baptist Church North Indianapolis assembled the first 200 lead test kits for distribution in cooperation with local organizations such as GroundWork Indy, the Kheprw Institute, the Flanner House and partner churches of the Indianapolis Ministerium. Another 200 kits will be distributed in Muncie, Indiana, in cooperation with Ball State University.


  Each kit includes five plastic water vials, a large bag to collect household dust, three small bags to collect soil samples and informational material on lead in the home. A numbered sticker is used to keep samples anonymous.


  “Through the year of the pandemic, First Baptist Church North Indianapolis sought to discern what ministries are needed, and will be needed in the future,” said the Rev. Ivan Douglas Hicks, senior minster at the church. “We are currently working on projects that will provide needed resources in our area, which could be considered a resource desert.”

  He said the lead testing project spoke to church leaders’ desire to provide leadership and programming to improve their members’ health. The fact that participants could learn about their home’s lead levels while keeping the home’s location anonymous was also significant, he said, as members were hesitant to pursue professional lead testing due to concerns about government repercussions.


  Another challenge is the fact that Indiana does not provide free home lead analysis until children test positive twice for elevated blood lead levels, Filippelli said. He said the state’s threshold for elevated blood lead levels – 10 micrograms per deciliter – is twice the amount regarded as elevated under national guidelines provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


  Analysis of the test kit samples will be conducted by Spencer Strout, a student in chemistry and geology at the School of Science at IUPUI, under the guidance of associate professor Gregory Druschel. Earlier contributors to the project include Natalie Nichols, who graduated in fall 2020, and John Shukle, a Ph.D. student at the school.


  Shukle said the project’s focus on tap water is significant since lead contamination is most common in homes with aging infrastructure, such as lead pipes, which can lose the protective mineral layer that prevents heavy metals from leeching into drinking water.

  “The challenge is we’re not talking about a large amount of lead; it’s relatively low concentrations,” Strout said. “But once you get any lead in your body, the acids in your stomach dissolve it, and it gets in your bloodstream. And once it’s in your blood, it’s very hard to get out since it’s stored in your bones.”


  The collection effort builds upon previous work from the Center for Urban Health, which has offered free soil analysis since 2012 and free dust analysis since 2018. The center had not been able offer free water testing until now because water collection requires special equipment compared to plastic baggies for dirt and soil.


  “There’s a wonderful citizen science aspect to this project,” said Jason Kelly, director of the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute. “Not only will the individuals who participate benefit directly, but the resulting data will also play a role in keeping communities safer more broadly.”


  This effort is supported by the IU Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative. Filippelli is executive director of the Environmental Resilience Institute at IU, part of the IU Prepared for Environmental Change initiative.


  Hicks is also a community research scholar in the American studies program at IUPUI.

IU students lead health education programs across South Bend region








            Jun 16, 2022
          









  Two semesters isn’t much time to research, plan and implement multiple new public health initiatives from the ground up. Yet that’s what 32 students at IU South Bend did during their senior year – and what up to 40 do every year – as part of a course that caps the educational experience for students in the dental hygiene program and health promotion concentration of the BS in Health Sciences in the Indiana University South Bend Dwyer College of Health Sciences.

  The two-semester course, led by Mallory Edmondson, a clinical assistant professor and director of the Division of Dental Education at IU South Bend, is required for students’ professional accreditation as dental hygienists. But it’s also an important path to understanding their power to instill healthy habits in their clients.


  “Dental hygiene students are typically very focused on clinical work and gaining experience with patients individually, so they can get a bit overwhelmed by the scope of this course,” said Edmondson. “But by the end of the experience, everyone’s really shifted their focus. They start to understand the power of speaking to many people at the same time and how they can impact their communities.”


  The other participants in the course – health promotion students – are less intimidated by public outreach due to the scope of their education as public health professionals, she said. But most have not had the chance to implement their own program.


  In the 2021-22 academic year, 32 students in Edmondson’s course conducted 13 public health education projects across the northern Indiana region, including St. Joseph and Elkhart counties.


  Among the projects were a three-day program to teach oral health to fourth grade students in the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County; a program to teach good sleep habits to high school students at Elkhart High School in Elkhart, Ind.; and a program about positive stress management for members of the South Bend Center for the Homeless, the region’s largest residential facility for individuals and families experiencing homelessness.


  Although oral hygiene is a natural topic for many of the students in the course, Edmondson said students are encouraged to investigate the needs of the communities to which they’re speaking to tailor topics to their needs.

  Sleep deprivation is a major concern among today’s high school students, for example, so the IU students who spoke at Elkhart High School focused their educational program on topics such as the effect of blue light from cell phones on sleep, as well as other strategies to get enough rest.


  Similarly, she said, stress is an understandably common health issue among people experiencing homelessness, so the students who spoke to this group focused their program on healthy coping methods. The program was also presented in partnership with “Wine and Canvas,” a local business that teaches people to paint in a fun and engaging environment, so the information was delivered in a format that provided participants an opportunity to relax.


  Yasmin Leal, a senior dental hygiene student who co-led the oral hygiene program at the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County, said her project primarily focused on encouraging club members to improve their oral health to prevent cavities and gingivitis. The project was delivered through an afterschool program sponsored by the club at Harrison Elementary School in South Bend.


  Topics included oral health care tips, as well as other strategies to maintain a healthy mouth, such as foods that strengthen teeth, how often to brush and floss, and when it’s recommended to visit a dentist. They also worked to make the information fun and engaging, such as an activity in which children made “mouths” out of marshmallows and construction paper.


  Edmondson also noted the students made an impact by handing out new toothbrushes after learning some of the children were sharing theirs with siblings at home.


  A former member of the Boys and Girls Club of St. Joseph County, Leal said she leveraged connections within the organization to arrange the project.

  “I am a former club member and knew I could count on them,” she said. “They’re always looking for guest speakers, professionals or programs to expand members’ knowledge and opportunities.”


  The program also made a measurable impact on the students, said Caylee Gee, a senior dental hygiene student, who co-led the project. To measure their program’s success, every participant in the course distributes pre- and post-tests to the individuals addressed on the first and last day of the outreach programs. Gee said the fourth-grade students from their program had an overall improvement of 42 percentage points, with post-test scores averaging 94 percent.


  “We realized that spending multiple days with the students had a large impact,” Gee said. “Plus, we could tell they enjoyed the program. They got excited about the activities every day, and they were eager for us to come back and work with them.”


  Both students said the course inspired a desire to continue engaging in the community.


  “Planning this program was a challenging but rewarding journey of self-discovery,” said Leal. “Over the course of the two semesters, I developed skills I didn’t know I had. Now that I know that I’m capable of creating and implementing a successful dental health program, it’s a skill I plan to use again.”

Researchers seeking private well owners in 4 states for study of PFAS in well water







For Immediate Release

            Jul 13, 2021
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – A research team from Indiana University and the nonprofit research institute RTI International is seeking help from “citizen scientists” in four states for its study of a group of chemicals known as PFAS in private wells.

  Supported by a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, the researchers will provide free testing kits to households in Washington, North Carolina, Indiana and Minnesota whose drinking water comes from private wells, enabling residents to collect and provide water samples for testing.


  PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which have been used for about 80 years in common household products, particularly those that are stain- and water-resistant. They have been associated with numerous health problems, including high blood pressure, thyroid disorders and specific cancers. Because they do not easily degrade, they are often referred to as “forever chemicals.”


  “PFAS contaminants last a long time in the environment and have been found as far away as the North Pole, but we know very little about where and how often they occur in private well water,” said Jacqueline MacDonald Gibson, chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington, who is principal investigator on the project. Amina Salamova, an associate scientist at the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, is co-investigator.


  “With 13% of the U.S. population getting their drinking water from private wells, filling this information gap is very important to making sure everyone has access to safe drinking water,” MacDonald Gibson added.


  Residents in Spokane County, Washington; Robeson County, North Carolina; Monroe County, Indiana; and Washington County, Minnesota, will receive postcards inviting them to participate in the study.


  The Washington, Minnesota and North Carolina counties were selected because each is the site of a major PFAS user or producer. Monroe County, Indiana, is included as a comparison to understand private well water vulnerability to PFAS contamination from scattered but common sources like septic tanks. Community leaders and residents of these four counties have been involved in study planning.

  Unlike in the other communities, some residents of Washington County, Minnesota, are already eligible for free PFAS water testing by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency as part of the state’s legal settlement with 3M Corp. The settlement was reached in 2010 in response to state concerns that PFAS from 3M landfills had contaminated local water supplies.


  The IU-RTI research team is communicating with the state and with local governments in Minnesota, but the team’s study is independent of state and local agencies. Minnesota residents who participate in the IU-RTI study will still be eligible for state-provided water testing and response actions, such as access to bottled water, household water filters or city water connections.


  To learn more about the study and to inquire about enrolling, visit Clean Water for US Kids. Residents of the four communities may be eligible even if they did not receive a postcard from the research team.


  The researchers will notify selected residents by email, U.S. mail or phone. Selected residents will get a free water test kit with instructions on how to collect and ship samples, and they will receive personalized but confidential test results.


  “We really look forward to connecting with residents interested in participating as citizen scientists to identify PFAS in rural well water,” said Jennifer Hoponick Redmon, a senior environmental health scientist at RTI who is co-principal investigator on the study. “Our hope is that this research helps us better predict and communicate where PFAS exists in well water across the U.S.”  


Chamindu Liyanapatirana, an analytical research chemist at RTI, is also a co-investigator and will analyze water samples for PFAS using state-of-the-art methods.


  What the partners are saying:


  “This is a great opportunity for private well owners. These test results will either give residents peace of mind or the knowledge that action needs to be taken to ensure their home has safe drinking water.” – Mike LaScuola, environmental health specialist at Spokane Regional Health District.


  “Water is sacred to indigenous peoples and others who live here in Robeson County, North Carolina. Water is vital to tribal subsistence, cultural practices, health and welfare, agricultural production, and economic development.” – Beverly Collins-Hall, principal chief of the Cherokees.


  “We are pleased to partner with the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington to test private wells in the county for PFAS. Because we do not currently test for PFAS, this will allow us to provide more comprehensive service to the community.” – Penny Caudill, health administrator for Monroe County, Indiana.


  The results of this study “will improve the overall health of our area.” – Bill Smith, director of public health for Robeson County.

AI researchers to help Indiana manufacturers reduce energy use


            Students to train for careers in emerging field of energy analytics
          






For Immediate Release

            Jul 28, 2022
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University researchers are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to help small and mid-sized Indiana manufacturers lower their carbon footprints and train students for careers in the emerging field of energy analytics.

  Faculty in the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at IU Bloomington and the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI will develop advanced manufacturing data models and analytics applications that will recommend processes and protocols to manufacturing companies so they can reduce their energy consumption – increasing factory efficiency and enhancing sustainability.


  “Currently, over 95% of Indiana manufacturers do not have analytics to correlate their energy usage with factory assembly lines, machines, shifts, operator usage patterns and more,” said Raj Acharya, associate vice president for research and AI innovation at IU, the John H. Rudy Professor of Computing, Engineering and Informatics at the Luddy School and principal investigator on the project. “This understanding, coupled with solutions to detected problems, will allow manufacturers to immediately see the improvement in their energy usage processes.”


  The researchers will also create educational resources, including a raw data repository and new curricula, and work alongside students to provide them with hands-on experience in developing and implementing analytics models to evaluate energy data.


  A cross-disciplinary collaboration

  The project is a collaboration among Indiana’s top research universities – IU, Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame – along with industry and nonprofit partners Amazon Web Services, Conexus Indiana, Energy Systems Network and the Emerging Manufacturing Collaboration Center, which is located in Indianapolis’ 16 Tech Innovation District.


  These partners are brought together by two concurrent programs:



AnalytiXIN, an initiative facilitated by the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership to develop a digital community, including a place-focused collaboration hub in Indianapolis, that will strengthen connections and encourage engagement of academic data science research and development talent with their industry peers to drive sustained innovation within Indiana.
  

Energy INsights, which helps participating Indiana manufacturers integrate an Amazon Web Services-connected platform, cutting-edge computer and sensor hardware, and AI and data science software tools to optimize energy efficiency at their factories.
  


  Researchers at IU, Purdue and Notre Dame will work closely to collect and analyze data gathered from Energy INsights and university testbeds to develop applications and a raw data repository, or a “data lake,” for use by the broader industry, research and education communities. The researchers will package their apps into customizable assets on the Amazon Web Services cloud, where they’ll be available to manufacturers.


  Leveraging IU expertise

Vikram Jadhao, associate professor of intelligent systems engineering at the Luddy School and co-principal investigator on the project, said the three universities will also work separately to put their own unique spin on the applications they develop, based on the expertise of their faculty.


  At IU, researchers bring together a variety of interdisciplinary experience, particularly in the Luddy School’s Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering, which was founded in 2016. The department connects faculty experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, modeling and simulation, cloud computing, and more.


  “We are probably the first institution in the world where engineering is viewed through the lens of artificial intelligence and computing,” Jadhao said.


  The Luddy School is also home to the Fibers and Additive Manufacturing Enabled Systems Laboratory, directed by Alexander Gumennik, an assistant professor of intelligent systems engineering in the school. The state-of-art lab consists of approximately 3,000 square feet of clean rooms, optical laboratories and manufacturing facilities with innovative highly customized equipment. This is where IU researchers plan to test and calibrate their energy analytics applications for the project.


  “Our university’s role in this one-of-a-kind project speaks to the world-class quality of the informatics, computing and engineering research program that we’ve built at IU,” IU Vice President for Research Fred H. Cate said. “This is a great example of how IU faculty and students are working at the forefront of emerging fields of research to help make Indiana a better place to live and work.”


  Training the workforce of the future


  Although much AI research has been applied to health and health care, Acharya said this is one of the first research projects to combine the fields of energy, AI and manufacturing.


  “No single curriculum currently offers this diverse set of training disciplines, presenting both a challenge and a unique opportunity,” Acharya said. “As part of this effort, we will create a unique training and education curriculum at the intersection of engineering, computer science, AI, machine learning and technology.”


  In addition to building industry tools, IU will develop extensive education and training materials, including lectures, tutorials, lab environments, training exercises and high-fidelity simulations of energy-saving solutions in practice. The project will also offer extensive hands-on experience and industry internship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at IU.


  Luddy School student Anisha Bajaj, who is pursuing a master’s degree in data science, said the project will be a good learning opportunity.


  “I am very excited about working on the project,” Bajaj said. “We are trying to predict future energy consumption for small-scale industries, and, using the prediction, we will try to recommend actions to save energy. This will help further my career goals by providing a real-world experience of applying my AI and machine-learning knowledge to a tangible problem.”


  The two-year project is already underway, with IU researchers setting up manufacturing testbeds on campus.


  Additional IU Bloomington and IUPUI faculty involved in the project include Ariful Azad, Prateek Sharma, Euzeli Cipriano Dos Santos and Travis Brown.

AI chatbot to increase cultural relevancy of STEM lessons, engage marginalized students








            Oct 17, 2023
          









  Indiana University researchers are developing a new chatbot that will make it easier for teachers to create more inclusive STEM activities — opening the door for marginalized students to engage in sustained STEM learning and STEM careers.


  The project, led by IU’s Jeremy Price and Sunandan Chakraborty, will leverage artificial intelligence to engage teachers in conversations about the best ways to adapt existing lesson plans and create new ones that are more inclusive and equitable for diverse students. Their work is supported by a one-year, $200,000 from the National Science Foundation.

  “STEM lesson plans in particular can be very difficult for teachers to make more culturally relevant for their students,” said Price, an assistant professor of technology, innovation and pedagogy in urban education at the School of Education at IUPUI and project director of the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning. “This chatbot will bring equity, inclusion and rigorous STEM to the forefront, providing important suggestions, pointers and resources to teachers to better engage with students, build a sense of community and prepare them for a life of STEM learning.”


  While the initial work is focused on K-12 teachers, the researchers hope students ultimately benefit the most. Introducing students to STEM learning activities that are relevant to them may get them more excited about future STEM learning and the various pathways it can lead them on in their lives and future careers. The researchers said this is particularly important for students of diverse backgrounds, who are often underrepresented in postsecondary science and engineering degrees.


  The researchers, including research assistants from Luddy’s M.S. in Applied Data Science program, will ensure the chatbot’s cultural sensitivity through community engagement. Building on the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning’s existing outreach and relationships in Indianapolis’ Near Eastside community, the chatbot will be trained using data from teachers and community members in the neighborhood who understand the importance of equity and inclusion in schools.


  The chatbot’s ability to offer a customized experience also makes it unique.


  “One of the chatbot’s most distinctive features will be its capacity to adapt and learn from the diverse backgrounds and preferences of users, tailoring interactions and activities with a high degree of context-sensitivity,” said Chakraborty, an assistant professor of data science in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at IUPUI. “This adaptive and personalized approach sets it apart, ensuring that it can effectively cater to the unique needs and characteristics of each participant.”


  The researchers will emphasize universal design to make the chatbot accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Additionally, they will build upon Chakraborty’s expertise with developing AI models and novel Natural Language Processing that can be used in real-world scenarios to develop more sophisticated, user-interaction-focused language models.


  To collect the necessary data to train the chatbot, affiliated faculty, staff and graduate students from the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning are beginning their work with the community this month. Focus groups will be convened to understand the ideas and aspirations that families and educators have for their students in STEM, with that input being used to train the chatbot.


  An early beta version of the chatbot will be ready for teachers to use within the next 12 months.

IU Athletics, local nonprofits help each other through concessions sales








            Mar 21, 2023
          


















Representatives of Scouts BSA Troops 148 and 1148 from St. Paul United Methodist Church sell concessions during a men's basketball game at IU Bloomington on Feb. 28. Photo by Chris Meyer, Indiana University Indiana University needs an army of volunteers to successfully operate all the concessions stands at sporting events. Fortunately, eager local nonprofits have provided IU with critical help while receiving needed — and record — funding in return.


  Nonprofits can earn up to 14% of their sales in commission. Roy Lubovsky, director of athletic dining, said he is forecasting that about $570,000 will be paid to the 25 nonprofits volunteering at football, men’s and women’s basketball, soccer, softball and baseball games this school year. That would be more than double what was paid out last year.


  The mutually beneficial relationship between the university and community organizations has produced a lot of good will, trust and enjoyment, and it also has provided many teenagers their first work experience.


  “Everyone recognizes the value of it — not just the funding, but for the youth and what they learn,” said Marni Karaffa, the concessions group leader for Scouts BSA Troops 148 and 1148 based at St. Paul United Methodist Church, which has helped IU for at least 25 years.


  Scouts and parents from the troops have staffed stands at football and men’s and women’s basketball games this season. The scouts have developed their communication skills by taking orders and working together, Karaffa said, and have learned how to work under pressure and keep track of inventory.


  “Working the games can be hard work,” she said. “It’s a challenge but a lot of fun.”


  Last year the troops made about $30,000 in commission, she said, and this year they expect to make at least $32,000. A portion of the funding pays for the troops’ equipment, gas money and propane for camping, and the rest is divided between scouts’ accounts based on how many shifts they’ve worked. They can use the money to cover the costs of special trips, uniforms and equipment, for example.


  Lubovsky also has tabbed the troops for help with additional events such as Little 500 and graduation, Karaffa said.


  “We feel very fortunate to have the opportunity,” she said. “They trust us to help and represent IU as well.”


  IU has invited nonprofit organizations to sell concessions for the past 27 years, Lubovsky said. A group is required to be a 501(c)3 registered nonprofit. Civic organizations, churches, youth sports organizations, Scout troops, parent-teacher organizations and animal rescue groups are among the current volunteering groups.

Photo by Chris Meyer, Indiana University Until three years ago, nonprofits typically had to wait four to six years for an opening to sell concessions because there was little turnover, Lubovsky said. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aging of some groups, the addition of alcohol sales and the success of the women’s basketball team have necessitated more concessions workers, he added.


  In fact, the need has been so great that Lubovsky hired Cindy Graham this school year as the nonprofit coordinator for concessions. She oversees recruiting nonprofits, training, scheduling and game-day meetings with nonprofit group leaders.


  Graham said there will be a great need for concessions help at football and men’s and women’s basketball games next year.


  IU pays for any alcohol permits needed and provides the training, inventory, uniforms and a free meal at games, Lubovsky said. The volunteers just need to bring a good attitude and their willingness to help. Youths who are at least 14 can work at a concession stand, and Lubovsky said that experience has led to him hiring some of the teens over the years.


  Nonprofits earn a minimum 10% of sales in commission and can earn 1% bonuses for meeting other standards, such as working both the football and basketball seasons, being on time and having the proper number of volunteers for an entire season. Some groups will make $40,000 to $50,000 this year, Lubovsky said.


  “What a way to significantly profit for your organization, and it’s good for a lot of groups to bring the kids in to work so they have ownership of what they are raising money for,” Graham said. “It’s great work experience.”


  Brooke Fleener, Bloomington High School North’s Best Buddies adviser and Unified track and bowling coach, said that working IU concession stands has given students with disabilities valuable work experience, and the funding has helped sustain the groups.


  “We’re grateful to IU for allowing us to participate,” Fleener said. “It’s not about only the money but also about employability skills and life skills and opportunities for kids who want jobs.”


  The students’ experiences selling concessions shows local employers that they are dependable and work hard, Fleener added.


  Bloomington North’s Best Buddies and Unified programs expect to make at least $7,200 working all the men’s basketball games this year, Fleener said. Last year they shared a football concession stand with their counterparts at Bloomington High School South.


  “We don’t have to worry about money for kids to participate, and they have snacks, T-shirts, uniforms, meals and help with tennis shoes if needed,” Fleener said.


  Nonprofits that are interested in volunteering to sell concessions at IU Athletics events should contact Graham at cjmorris@iu.edu or 812-327-6486.

Sports Innovation survey reveals Central Indiana sports loyalties








            Sep 8, 2017
          












      Indiana University men’s basketball was selected as the second-most popular hometown team in a survey of 500 Central Indiana sports fans.
    



  The 2017 Indianapolis Colts season is about to get underway, and Central Indiana sports fans will be paying close attention – closer than they do with any other area sports team or entity.


  According to a study of 500 Central Indiana residents about their perceptions of sports leagues and teams, conducted by the Sports Innovation Institute at IUPUI, the Colts and the NFL are by far the most popular. When asked to choose one favorite hometown team, 221 of 500 respondents picked the Colts, four times as many as chose the second-favorite team, and 159 of the 500 said the NFL was their favorite league.


  The survey was conducted in mid-July across a wide range of fans over 18 years of age, with an average age of 47.


  “Every way you can look at the NFL and the Colts, they share the strongest brand image and position in the local market,” said David Pierce, an associate professor in the Indiana University School of Physical Education and Tourism Management at IUPUI, who oversaw the survey for the Sports Innovation Institute.


  Respondents were asked to rank their overall feelings about sports leagues on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest. The NFL scored a 4.47, even higher than “sports in general” at 4.26.


  The Colts scored a 4.36 among respondents asked for their overall feelings on a scale of 1 to 5 about hometown teams and major events; nothing else scored above 4. Following the Colts were Butler men’s basketball at 3.97, the Indianapolis 500 at 3.95, and then a tie between the Indiana Pacers and the Indianapolis Indians at 3.94.


  “The Indians’ score is pretty competitive for something that’s at the minor-league level of competition,” Pierce said. “That speaks to the team’s game experience.”


  The second-favorite league/entity after the NFL among respondents was college basketball, and IU men’s basketball was the second choice for favorite hometown team behind the Colts, with 54 of the 500 respondents choosing the Hoosiers.


  A question of “hometown fandom” allowed respondents to choose more than one favorite team/major event, and more than half of all respondents – 77.2 percent – named the Colts. They were followed by the Pacers, at 49.8 percent, the Indianapolis 500, at 44.2 percent, IU men’s basketball, at 38 percent, and Butler men’s basketball, at 36.2 percent.


  Pierce said that future installations of the survey will be intriguing to watch in terms of whether any teams or leagues become more or less popular. The LPGA Tour, for example, is debuting a new tournament this weekend in Indianapolis. The LPGA ranked 21st out of 23 leagues for overall feelings by respondents.

Washington County expanding collaboration with IU Center for Rural Engagement


            Community-identified projects to be at the center of the partnership
          






For Immediate Release

            Jan 27, 2020
          









  SALEM, Ind. – Building upon the energy of nearly two years of arts, cultural and quality-of-place planning and programming with the Indiana University Center for Rural Engagement, Washington County will partner with the center’s Sustaining Hoosier Communities initiative to connect faculty and students with community-identified projects.


  A yearlong engaged teaching collaboration, Sustaining Hoosier Communities harnesses more than 20 IU Bloomington courses and the energy of hundreds of students to address projects including health and wellness, infrastructure planning, and natural resources management. This initiative received international recognition as the 2019 Outstanding Program of the Year from the Educational Partnerships for Innovation in Communities-Network.





      The Center for Rural Engagement has an ongoing rural arts partnership with Washington County, including Jacobs School of Music masterclasses and performances with Salem Schools Bands.




  “We are so excited to partner with the Center for Rural Engagement,” said Judy Johnson, executive director of the Washington County Community Foundation. “Over the last year, we have had many community meetings and opportunities for our citizens to express their ideas for creating our preferred future in Washington County. I think the timing is perfect for Washington County; as we begin a new decade, we have the opportunity to work together to make our community an amazing place to live, work, play and raise a family.”


  About 50 miles southeast of the IU Bloomington campus, Washington County is home to 28,415 residents, vast natural resources including a portion of the state’s longest hiking trail – the Knobstone Trail – and historic sites such as the John Hay Center complex and Beck’s Mill. The county’s economy is rooted in agriculture and the metal and lumber industry. Washington County will be the fourth county to partner with the center on the Sustaining Hoosier Communities initiative.


  With the center’s launch in 2018, Washington County established a strategic effort focused on quality of place, including an ongoing rural arts series involving the Jacobs School of Music, IU Cinema, the Department of English, and other Arts and Humanities Council campus partners.


  “The IU Center for Rural Engagement welcomes this opportunity to deepen our partnership with Washington County during the 2020-21 academic year,” said Kerry Thomson, the center’s executive director. “This engaged teaching initiative will connect a breadth of resources to projects that meet the community’s goals and continue to expand local capacity for new initiatives with an intensive, comprehensive approach.”


  Community meetings to generate ideas, hear feedback, and discuss possible projects and plans will be held throughout the county in February. Each meeting will take place from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on the following dates:



Feb. 4: Campbellsburg Community Building, 21 W. Oak St. in Campbellsburg.
  

Feb. 6: Pekin Park Community Building, 325 E. Karnes Court in New Pekin.
  

Feb. 11: Senior Citizen Center, 1705 N. Shelby St. in Salem.
  


  These meetings are open to the public, and light refreshments will be served. Residents are encouraged to attend any of the scheduled sessions for a full discussion and planning activities. Residents are also welcome to contact the Washington County Community Foundation at 812-883-7334 or email Judy Johnson at director@wccf.biz to share ideas and learn more about this partnership.


  IU Center for Rural Engagement


  The Indiana University Center for Rural Engagement improves the lives of Hoosiers through collaborative initiatives that discover and deploy scalable and flexible solutions to common challenges facing rural communities. Working in full-spectrum community innovation through research, community-engaged teaching and student service, the center builds vision, harnesses assets and cultivates sustainable leadership structures within the communities with which it engages to ensure long-term success.

IU Athletics extends helping hand to Florida volleyball team in aftermath of Hurricane Irma








            Sep 15, 2017
          









  The Florida Gulf Coast University volleyball players found themselves stranded in North Carolina last weekend, unable to return home to Fort Myers as Hurricane Irma headed toward their beach town.


  The team had just finished a tournament in North Carolina and wasn’t due in Indiana to play in the Hoosier Classic tournament for several days. But as storm surges and heavy winds raked the southwest Florida coast, flooding homes, collapsing buildings and displacing families, Indiana University Athletics searched for a way to help the team during the devastating time.

  IU head volleyball coach Sherry Dunbar-Kruzan picked up the phone and invited the Florida Gulf Coast team to come to Indiana early.


  “We are happy that Florida Gulf Coast is here and safe. We wanted to do what he could to make them feel comfortable this week,” Dunbar-Kruzan said. “The volleyball community is great, and if we were in this situation, others would step up and help us.”


  Along with making them feel comfortable, IU wanted to help the players stick to as much of a normal schedule as possible. Since arriving in Bloomington on Monday evening, the team has been using IU Athletics’ practice facility and weight room, hosting study tables and reviewing film. IU is also covering half of the team’s hotel and travel expenses for the extra days they had to be in town.

  Florida Gulf Coast head coach Matt Botsford is familiar with Hoosier hospitality. Before he began his tenure at Florida Gulf Coast, he served as an assistant coach at Notre Dame, IUPUI and the University of Indianapolis. During some down time this week, he took the team to Indianapolis to explore the city, have dinner and attempt to take their minds off the destruction they may return home to.


  “This week has been overwhelming for us,” Botsford said. “We are so thankful to IU, the coaching staff and administration for welcoming us with open arms and all they have done for us.”


  Both teams and their coaches are excited to play in the Hoosier Classic tournament this weekend, and they encourage the community to come out to watch.


  “Florida Gulf Coast has a great program, and we hope people will come out and watch some great volleyball this weekend in Bloomington,” Dunbar-Kruzan said.


  The Hoosier Classic takes place today and Saturday, Sept. 15 and 16, at the University Gym. A full schedule is available on the IU Athletics website.

Dubois County, Center for Rural Engagement partner on Sustaining Hoosier Communities projects







For Immediate Release

            Feb 7, 2022
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University and Dubois County are expanding their community development collaboration with the Center for Rural Engagement’s Sustaining Hoosier Communities initiative.


  Sustaining Hoosier Communities connects IU Bloomington faculty, their courses and the energy of hundreds of students to address projects such as health and wellness, infrastructure planning, and natural resource management. Representing an estimated value of $150,000 in research, inquiry and implementation hours, Sustaining Hoosier Communities brings an extensive suite of university resources to the partnership. This initiative received international recognition as the 2019 Outstanding Program of the Year from the Educational Partnerships for Innovation in Communities-Network.

  “Sustaining involves helping, but most importantly, recognizing the fundamental characteristics of our community and through them, building up a community that supports growth in an equitable manner,” said Rossina Sandoval, member of the Sustaining Hoosier Communities Dubois County community committee and director of community engagement for Southwest Dubois School Corp. “The SHC partnership with the IU Center for Rural Engagement offers unbiased, expert counsel and direction towards the goals we envision for Dubois County.”


  Dubois County has actively worked with the Center for Rural Engagement on arts and culture, creative placemaking, local food system expansion and community capacity development projects since 2018. Thriving programs – including the activation of Huntingburg’s Market Street Park for the 4th Fridays music festivals and the recent Indiana Department of Health I-HOPE initiative to reduce racial inequities in health – have emerged through this existing partnership.


  The county is also poised to partner with IU and higher education institutions across the state through the Hoosier Enduring Legacy Program, developing strategic plans for federal coronavirus recovery funding.


  “Education and collaboration have long been strategies propelling Dubois County forward, creating innovative approaches that drive the development of our people, culture and economy,” said Christian Blome, co-coordinator for the Sustaining Hoosier Communities Dubois County community committee and assistant vice president and dean at Vincennes University Jasper. “The SHC partnership with the IU Center for Rural Engagement recognizes how special Dubois County is, and it provides us an opportunity to leverage the intellectual property of Indiana University to achieve our individual, corporate and organizational goals – now is the time to dream big, come together and seize the moment.”


  The history of Dubois County is rooted in entrepreneurship and innovation. Many national and global organizations – including Kimball International, Jasper Engines and Transmissions, and OFS Brands – call Dubois County home. The county is a manufacturing and agricultural hub in the state, employing more than 37,000 people in the Indiana Uplands region.


  Dubois County hosts an annual cultural festival and a variety of community resources managed by the Association of Latino Americans of Southern Indiana. The county is also well known for its historic League Stadium, the setting of the beloved sports comedy-drama film, “A League of Their Own.” Located approximately 70 miles southwest of the IU Bloomington campus, Dubois County will be the fifth community to partner with the center on the Sustaining Hoosier Communities initiative.


  “Indiana University is delighted to collaborate with Dubois County, bridging this innovative community with transformative resources at IU,” said Kerry Thomson, executive director of the Center for Rural Engagement. “This initiative builds upon our already successful partnership, giving our students a foundation for professional, high-impact experiences right here in Indiana while also creating a conduit of energy and strategy that supports the community’s goals.”


  Community meetings to generate ideas, gather feedback, and discuss possible projects and plans will be held throughout the county in February, from 6:30 to 8 p.m. EST on the following dates:



Feb. 16: Vincennes University Jasper, Center for Technology, Innovation and Manufacturing, 961 College Ave. in Jasper. This meeting will include Spanish interpretation.
  

Feb. 22: Ferdinand Community Center Mobel Room, 1710 Community Drive in Ferdinand.
  

Feb. 23: Old Town Hall, 309 N. Geiger St. in Huntingburg This meeting will include Spanish interpretation.
  

Feb. 24: Parklands Pavilion, 800 W. 15th St. in Jasper. This meeting will include Spanish interpretation.
  


  These meetings are open to the public. Residents are encouraged to attend any of the scheduled sessions for a full discussion and planning activities. Current public gathering policies for Indiana University will be observed; masks are required in indoor settings.


  Residents can contact Sustaining Hoosier Communities program Dubois County community committee co-coordinator Dennis Tedrow at dennis.tedrow@vinu.edu or 812-482-3288 to share ideas and learn more about this partnership.


  The Sustaining Hoosier Communities website has more information about the program and past projects.

Day of Caring brings volunteerism off campus

  More than 300 IUPUI students, faculty and staff members spent Saturday morning volunteering across Indianapolis. The annual Day of Caring was Oct. 21, which saw community involvement outside on a beautiful fall day as well as inside some of the city’s nonprofit organizations.


  Each fall, IUPUI partners with United Way to host Day of Caring, bringing Jaguars in service to the Indianapolis community. Volunteers impact the nonprofits and the community overall by helping to complete projects the organizations may not have the time, staff or money to address.


  Some Jags trimmed out paper snowflakes at the Indiana State Museum to supply young visitors for the winter season, while others planted trees near Gladstone and 10th streets. The tree planting was a partnership with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful.


  Other service opportunities included harvesting plants from the urban garden at Growing Places Indy and Fletcher Place Community Center, maintaining trails at White River State Park, and marking storm drains with the City of Indianapolis Department of Public Works. Multiple student organizations took part, such as Honors College Floor 8, National Residence Hall Honorary, Alpha Phi Omega and Pre-Dental Club, in addition to various first-year seminar courses.

Kinsey Institute and The Trevor Project establish new research partnership on LGBTQ mental health







For Immediate Release

            Jun 10, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – The critical need for research on LGBTQ youth mental health and suicide prevention – made even more critical by the COVID-19 pandemic – has led to a new partnership between the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, the premier research institute on human sexuality and relationships, and The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning youth.


  The formal research partnership will enable collaborations including data sharing and innovative project design between the two organizations. These collaborations will leverage the Kinsey Institute’s scientific expertise in methodology and data analysis to support The Trevor Project’s efforts to advance knowledge of the clinical implications of suicide and LGBTQ mental health.

  “The Kinsey Institute is dedicated to impactful research on sexuality, relationships and well-being, so we are very excited to join forces with the incredible team at The Trevor Project to collaboratively research urgent issues around LGBTQ mental health and suicide,” said Justin R. Garcia, acting executive director and research director of the Kinsey Institute and a Ruth N. Halls Associate Professor of Gender Studies.


  The Kinsey Institute’s recent Sex and Relationships in the Time of COVID-19 study found that LGBTQ participants were more worried about the risk of COVID-19, and reported higher levels of stress and pandemic-related loneliness.


  “Research is critical to our understanding of sexual and gender diversity,” Garcia said. “This partnership leverages the expertise of both our organizations and promises to result in important research that can be applied to make the world a better place, especially for LGBTQ youth.”

  “The Trevor Project’s Research Department aims to produce and use innovative research that brings new knowledge and clinical implications to the field of suicidology and LGBTQ youth mental health,” said Amy E. Green, director of research at The Trevor Project. “Partnering with a premier research entity like the Kinsey Institute will foster our goal of advancing scientific inquiry in ways that support and protect the lives of LGBTQ youth. We look forward to drawing on our shared expertise to create a better world for LGBTQ youth.”


  The research partnership could also lead to educational outreach opportunities for IU faculty, staff, students and the community, supporting IU’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.


  About The Trevor Project


The Trevor Project offers a suite of 24/7 crisis intervention and suicide prevention programs, including TrevorLifeline, TrevorText and TrevorChat, as well as the world’s largest safe space social networking site for LGBTQ youth, TrevorSpace. The Trevor Project also operates an education program with resources for youth-serving adults and organizations, an advocacy department fighting for pro-LGBTQ policy, and a research team to discover the most effective means to help young LGBTQ people in crisis and end suicide. If you or someone you know needs help or support, The Trevor Project’s trained crisis counselors are available 24/7 at 1-866-488-7386, via chat at TheTrevorProject.org/Help or by texting START to 678678.


  About the Kinsey Institute


  For over 70 years, the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University has been the premier research institute on human sexuality and relationships and a trusted source for evidence-based information on critical issues in sexuality, gender and reproduction. Its research program integrates scholarly fields including neuroscience, anthropology, psychology and gender studies. The Kinsey Institute Library and Special Collections encompass over 500,000 items spanning 2,000 years of human sexual behavior and are a destination research collection for scholars and students.

The Hancock County Promise brought kindergartners and parents to IUPUI to learn about college








            Sep 20, 2018

  When roughly 1,000 kindergartners hop in a bus and head toward a place full of activities planned just for them, there is bound to be excitement. “Today, I’m going to college,” screamed a voice from the McCordsville Elementary bus, which participated in the Hancock County Promise.


  On Sept. 14, students from 47 classrooms at 12 elementary schools around Hancock County met at Carroll Stadium to participate in the “Walk into Your Future” event.


  This event gives kindergartners the opportunity to visit a college campus, participate in a field day, learn about college and interact with college student volunteers. The “promise” this event makes to the children is that their community believes in and supports them in their journey toward having a bright future.


  The Hancock County Promise is sponsored by six organizations around 18 Hancock County communities dedicated to supporting kids in its county to go to college and reach their full potential.


  When the children sign up, parents are given the opportunity to open a CollegeChoice 529 Direct Savings Account for their kids to start saving for college. The moment a parent signs up their child for an account, the community’s sponsoring organizations automatically contribute $25 to the college fund. Between then and Christmas, if the child raises $25 more, the sponsors will put an additional $25 into the account, totaling a $50 donation from them to the child’s future.

  Scott Shipley, director of secondary education for Mt. Vernon Community Schools and chairperson for the Hancock County Promise, believes wholeheartedly in the mission of the Promise and said he could not thank IUPUI enough for allowing Hancock County to host the event on campus.


  Shipley said research shows that if kids have hope and belief that college is a place for them, they are more likely to attend. If they have a college savings account, they are three times more likely to go to college, even if they have less than $500 in the account. Finally, if they believe they can succeed in college, children are four times more likely to graduate from postsecondary school.


  Jennifer Zotz, senior program coordinator for Campus Visits and Events, and Jessica Klage, associate director of Campus Visits and Events, agree with Shipley’s confidence in the program’s goals and thoughts of how important this is for the children and the community.


  “Even though this event is huge for our campus, it’s only a piece of a puzzle that makes a larger picture,” Zotz said. “In the classrooms, kids do coursework around what a person needs to do to go to college, and schools work with parents on trying to educate them on how they can save for their kids’ college. Through all this, we’re telling a whole community we value education on every level, not just seniors in high school.”


  “Educating students at a young age about college being even a possibility is so important,” Klage said. “For some kids, this might be the only time they set foot on a college campus. Also, the partnership with Hancock County and the children is important for our community’s growth.”


  Not only do the staff of the Hancock County Promise and IUPUI think it is important, but student volunteers and organizations from IUPUI also see the benefits of this program.


  Jagathon volunteer Jordyn Boecker said it is important to let kids know they are welcome and at home in college. This might encourage them to enroll later in life, said the sophomore, who is studying psychology.


  IUPUI men’s soccer player Gianni Catenacci said that wanting to be a role model is only part of the reason he volunteered.


  “Having the kids see how much fun we are having while at college might plant a seed in the kids’ heads about wanting to go someday,” the sophomore biology major said. “That’s half the fun right there.”

Unity and university: IU provides roadmap for building Latino resource center in southern Indiana








            Feb 21, 2024
          









  Board members of the Asociación Latineamericana del Sur de Indiana, or ALASI, in Dubois County knew that Latino residents in southern Indiana faced several barriers in their daily lives. To help quantify those barriers and how best to address them, the board turned to Indiana University for help.

  ALASI board president Evelyn Rivas recounted her mother’s journey after fleeing war-torn El Salvador in 1987.


  “She faced many challenges, one being the language barrier,” Rivas said. “But she was fueled with hope that the United States could offer her what her country had not been able to.”


  Rivas said her mother worked two full-time jobs for several years, cared for their family and took English classes.


  “Even then she struggled to understand the culture, the traditions and the systems of her new home,” Rivas said.


  The county’s Latino community has been steadily growing for the past three decades. More than 9 percent of Dubois County residents identify as Latino, and in the Southwest Dubois County School Corp. in Huntingburg, 34 percent of students identify as Latino.


  In addition to hosting programs and social events in the Dubois County area, ALASI fielded daily questions about community resources, immigration assistance, child care needs and health care navigation.


  To name and quantify needs and barriers, ALASI turned to the Indiana University Center for Rural Engagement to conduct a needs assessment among Latino residents. The assessment identified the top-ranked needs as education, employment, child care, health, food and immigration support.


  “It was a very important document,” ALASI board member Rossina Sandoval said. “We know there is a need, but for the first time, we could prove that there is a need.”


  The ALASI board dreamed of a resource center where anyone could get support. ALASI again linked up with IU to make this vision a reality. Through the Center for Rural Engagement’s Sustaining Hoosier Communities program, adjunct instructor Trent Engbers and the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs’ Online Master of Public Affairs program were ready to develop a plan.


  Students in the O’Neill Online Master of Public Affairs program come from around the world in late summer each year to participate in O’Neill Online Week in Indiana. Composed of working professionals, the O’Neill Online Week class unites decades of professional experience collectively.


  Before arriving in Indiana, students learn more about their partnering organization and its project alongside the public affairs experts at O’Neill. When they arrive, students begin the week in the partnering community, meeting with organization representatives and local leaders. They return to the IU Bloomington campus to develop their proposal, which they present to the community partner at the end of the week.

  “They get to know the people beyond an academic issue and understand the issue through the eyes of the client,” Engbers said.


  ALASI came to the O’Neill Online program with an overarching question: How can we better serve the growing Latino community in Dubois County? Before jumping into a resource center plan, the class quickly identified that there were two local Latino-serving entities: Latino-led ALASI and the Latino Collaboration Table, a consortium of corporate and governmental stakeholders. Inspired by this project and the recommendations of the class, the two organizations united under ALASI to bolster their strengths and better serve the community.


  “The class, ALASI and the Latino Collaboration Table started to think about what a more unified Latino-serving organization looked like, and that gave them a real impetus that had lasting impact,” Engbers said.


  The O’Neill class created a phased implementation plan for a brick-and-mortar resource center to ensure the community fully included Latino residents in local services, programs and opportunities. The first phase of the plan was focused on securing initial funding needed to fully open the center.


  “In simplest terms, it really created a roadmap for us to coalesce around,” ALASI board member Christian Blome said. “We have all these passionate people and resources in Dubois County, and this gave our mission validity.”


  The ALASI Resource Center opened its doors one year later on Sept. 15, 2023, with foundational support from German American Bank, OFS, Menke Foundation, Meyer Distributing/Meyer Logistics, Farbest Foods, Memorial Hospital, Kimball International, Old National Bank, Kimball Electronics Jasper and Springs Valley Bank & Trust; and through collaborations with the city of Jasper, city of Huntingburg and Southwest Dubois County School Corp. The board launched its search for the center’s inaugural executive director and appointed Joanna Howard to the role on Jan. 15.


  “Today we achieved what other communities with more manpower and more resources have not been able to do,” Rivas said at the Sept. 15 ribbon-cutting ceremony. “Today we show unity in advancing equity in our community and advancing cultural competence. Today we demonstrate that the diversity we have in our community is not only enriching us, but it is making our community stronger and better.”


  Located at 511 E. Fourth St. in Huntingburg, the center is focused on enhancing cultural competence by collaborating with community and service providers to facilitate access to health, housing and social services resources; promote education equity; and celebrate cultures.


  ALASI continues to implement the plan the O’Neill Online class developed, looking ahead to adding a liaison staff role and establishing a sustained funding model for the future. The board is envisioning new opportunities for ALASI to connect the Latino community with recreational, arts and cultural programs — all with future IU partnerships in mind.


  “This was hard work, but I can’t imagine where we would have been without the collaboration,” Blome said.

NCAA and Department of Defense expand concussion study with $22.5 million in new funding







For Immediate Release

            Oct 31, 2018
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – The world’s most comprehensive concussion study is being dramatically expanded with an infusion of nearly $22.5 million in new funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the NCAA to examine the impacts of head injuries over several years.

  The NCAA-DOD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium, known as the CARE Consortium, was established as part of the broader NCAA-DOD Grand Alliance in 2014, with the goals of understanding how concussions affect the brain and identifying ways to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention.


  Led by Indiana University School of Medicine, the University of Michigan and the Medical College of Wisconsin, in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University, the study has collected data on more than 39,000 student-athletes and cadets at 30 colleges and military service academies – including more than 3,300 who have experienced concussions. This represents the largest sample of concussions ever researched in a single study.

  The initial phase of the study – made possible by a joint NCAA-Department of Defense grant of $30 million – focused on the acute effects of concussions by evaluating concussed participants with a sequence of clinical and advanced research tests in the immediate hours, days and weeks after the injury, and comparing the results with baseline tests administered at the start of the study.


  The new phase will include comprehensive testing of the participants when they leave college and up to four years after their collegiate sports or service academy career has ended. This expanded approach will enable researchers to study the intermediate and cumulative effects of concussion and repetitive head impact exposure. Importantly, researchers hope to differentiate between the effects of concussion, repetitive head impact, and sports participation with no history of either concussion or repetitive head impact exposure.


  “We have gathered important information about the short-term effects of concussions over the past few years, but there is still a lot we do not understand about how our brains respond to different types of impact over time,” said Dr. Thomas W. McAllister, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Indiana University School of Medicine and the leader of the study’s administrative and operations center. “By comparing these groups across multiple years, we think we can parse out the effects of concussions, versus repetitive head impacts, versus normal life at university. This is critical for us to make informed decisions that protect our athletes, members of the military and other members of our communities.”


  The evaluations will include clinical tests to assess attributes such as balance and memory but also will probe changes to participants’ psychological health to determine what role, if any, concussions and repetitive head impacts may have on depression, anxiety and emotional control. Researchers also will continue to conduct advanced research tests, including genetic analysis, brain imaging and blood tests to measure biomarkers associated with inflammation and nervous system dysfunction. It is conceivable that the advanced research tests will help identify genes and other objective markers that render an athlete or cadet more or less susceptible to concussion or injury from repetitive head impacts.


  The NCAA is providing $12.5 million in funding over two years for the second stage of research. The Department of Defense approved a two-year grant of nearly $10 million.


  IU Bloomington is among the institutions with athletes participating in the study.

  “This new phase of funding represents a critical extension to the original study goals, allowing us to take an unprecedented look at cumulative and persistent effects of concussion and repetitive head impact exposure,” said Dr. Brian Hainline, NCAA chief medical officer. “What we learn from this research will advance the science of traumatic brain injury and improve our understanding of how to best support the health and well-being of student-athletes, not only during their collegiate athletics experience but beyond.”


  In addition to expanding the scope of the study, the CARE Consortium is adding a representative from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences to its research team. Dr. Paul F. Pasquina is a retired Army colonel, professor and chair of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine and director of the Center for Rehabilitation Sciences Research. His role with the CARE Consortium is to promote and facilitate the involvement of the four military service academies in the consortium.


  “Optimizing the health and performance of our warfighters is paramount to enhancing the readiness and lethality of the force,” Terry M. Rauch, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense (Health Readiness Policy and Oversight), said regarding the Department of Defense’s participation in the study. “Traumatic brain injuries are a major readiness concern as our warfighters are particularly susceptible to these injuries during combat and training. The department is leading efforts in research to better understand how to prevent, diagnose and treat TBIs across the range of military operations. However, much more work needs to be done, and this partnership with the NCAA and participating academic institutions provides valuable evidence to optimize the health and performance of our warfighters.”


  Other study leaders include:


Steven Broglio, professor of kinesiology and director of the Michigan Concussion Center at the University of Michigan. Broglio leads the longitudinal clinical study core, which oversees all clinical aspects of the study.
  
Michael McCrea, professor of neurosurgery and co-director of the Center for Neurotrauma Research at the Medical College of Wisconsin. McCrea leads the advanced research core, which includes head impact sensor technologies, advanced neuroimaging and biological markers that include detailed genetic testing.
  
Indiana University School of Medicine, under the direction of McAllister, which provides regulatory and fiduciary oversight, as well as biostatistics and data management, neuroimaging, bioinformatics, biomarkers/biospecimen management, and other support resources for the consortium. Indiana University School of Medicine partners with the Datalys Center and QuesGen Systems in this effort.
  


  Already, the CARE Consortium has generated information related to important topics such as the impact of removing student-athletes from play after a concussion; the influence of age at the time of first concussion; sleep and concussion recovery; and tools and tests used to assess concussions. A list of the scientific publications resulting from the CARE Consortium study may be found on the NCAA Sport Science Institute website.

IU psychology professor and her team promote authentic belonging in STEM
IU psychology professor and her team promote authentic belonging in STEMA recent study by Amanda Diekman’s group in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, supported by 3M, found that structured reflection supports minoritized students’ wellbeing.
Indiana University professor Amanda Diekman and her team are moving beyond the laboratory to transform research into action through an industry partnership.
In a January publication in Scientific Reports, Diekman, a professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences within the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington, found that guided written reflection improved students’ attitudes and feelings of belonging in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Now, her team works with faculty at IU and other universities to implement this style of reflection in the classroom.Amanda Diekman, professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences
For Diekman, the study was a chance to challenge the social perception of STEM. People tend to think of STEM as a platform for individual success, she explained: an opportunity to build knowledge, competency, and mastery. “But compared to other fields, like law, or medicine, or business, STEM is consensually perceived as lacking in communal opportunities,” she said. These communal opportunities are especially valued by women and minoritized racial groups. So, Diekman wondered, could bringing forward the social and community impacts of STEM benefit these minoritized groups?
“That was our basic psychological question for a long time; we did a lot of work on that,” said Diekman, “and then I got an email out of the blue one day.” The message came from Jayshree Seth: the Chief Science Advocate at 3M, the company behind Scotch™ tape, N95 respirators, and many other products. Diekman’s work had resonated with Seth, and she wanted to support further research and outreach given her own experiences and 3M’s commitment to STEM education and to diversity in STEM fields to drive innovation.Jayshree Seth, Amanda’s collaborator at 3M.
With funding from 3M, the team recruited 466 STEM undergraduate students, half of whom identified as Black, Latinx, and/or Native American (classified by the National Science Foundation as minoritized groups in STEM). Half of the students were randomly assigned to reflect on the challenges in their STEM major while the other half considered those challenges integrated with their inspiration for pursuing STEM. Each experimental group wrote for five minutes to respond to their assigned prompt, then ranked their feelings of belonging, enjoyment, and stress within their major.Amanda and Jayshree pose together in front of their slides at the 2024 AAAS Annual Meeting.
The researchers found that students who reflected on their inspiration reported greater enjoyment in pursuing STEM, higher feelings of belonging within the field, and a greater capacity to handle stress than those who reflected only on their challenges. This trend was consistent across students with different racial and gender identities.
“What we showed was a very robust effect,” said Diekman. “It's not simply that students who tend to think about purpose also tend to do well,” she explained, but also that students can be guided towards cognitive benefits through reflection.
However, the authors highlighted, “The ‘same’ STEM classroom is not psychologically equivalent to all students.” Minoritized students reported overall higher levels of stress and lower levels of coping resources compared to their majoritized colleagues. Even purpose reflection didn’t remedy this gap; minoritized women who reflected on their inspiration for pursuing STEM still reported higher levels of stress than majoritized men who reflected on their challenges.Amanda presenting this work at the 2024 AAAS Annual Meeting (Credit to Robb Cohen photography).
While individual reflection can’t wholly address such a systemic inequity, explained Diekman, it’s a good place to start. The norms, practices, and policies of institutions shape broad ideas about what STEM is and who belongs in it. “And a classroom can be an institution, right?” she reflected. “So, how can we better prepare instructors to understand and recognize [the importance of identity reflection], and let students have space to explore those identities?”
The next phase of the partnership with 3M and Diekman’s team includes working with STEM faculty and staff at IU and other institutions, both in one-on-one and in group formats, to help them implement purpose and identity-based reflection in their classes.
Logan Paul, a faculty member in the Luddy School, met with Diekman’s team multiple times via Zoom. “The conversations with Amanda’s team helped me better equip myself to foster belonging in my classroom and by extension in STEM,” he said. Paul worked with the team to revise and realign a reflective assignment and in-class activity that asks students to consider the motivations that brought them to his course and how they plan to implement the knowledge they’ll learn throughout the semester.
Paul’s experience reflects that of many faculty who have partnered with Diekman’s team. Class by class, these collaborations turn theory into practice, helping students feel more at home in their STEM major.
Diekman’s team welcomes new partnerships with STEM instructors at IU and other institutions. The team also offers a growing repository of reflection exercises, named PRISM – Purpose Reflection Integration in STEM Modalities. Instructors can view and adopt these exercises for their own classes at http://go.iu.edu/prism.

‘Sex that moves mountains’: Spawning salmon play significant role in shaping landscapes







For Immediate Release

            Oct 19, 2017
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – When salmon spawn, the earth moves – not immediately, but over the course of hundreds of thousands or millions of years. That’s the conclusion of a study, co-authored by an Indiana University geologist, which finds that salmon can play a significant role in shaping mountain landscapes.

  Brian Yanites, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences, and his co-authors model the effect of spawning salmon on riverbed erosion and calculate how it affects mountain landscapes.


  Their paper, “Sex that moves mountains: The influence of spawning fish on river profiles over geologic timescales,” is being published by the journal Geomorphology.


  The authors examine how spawning salmon stir up sediment in riverbeds and accelerate the erosion of river channels. They combine that information with mathematical formulations of sediment transport and erosion to show how the presence of salmon reshapes mountains and valleys.


  “While the influence of salmon reproduction on sediment transport has been known, this is the first paper that has suggested the process could influence the height and shape of the landscape over long timescales and large spatial scales, such as the extent of a mountain range,” Yanites said.


  One surprising finding was that salmon could influence erosion significantly. For example, the authors calculated that a landscape where salmon spawn could be up to 30 percent lower than a comparable landscape with no salmon present.


  Salmon hatch in fresh water, live their lives in oceans, then return to rivers and streams to spawn. Female salmon turn on their sides and flap their tails to build nests, called redds, in which they lay eggs. Males then fertilize the eggs, which develop and hatch. In building the nests, the female salmon stir up sediment and help expose the riverbed, leading to more erosion nearby and downstream.





      Brian Yanites
    



  Some salmon are more potent mountain-movers than others, according to the study. Different species prefer to build their redds in different types of sediment, from the coarse grains found in the upper reaches of streams to the finer grains found downstream. Chinook salmon will spawn in a wider range of grain sizes than sockeye and pink salmon, the other two species studied; therefore, chinook salmon can disrupt longer reaches of rivers and streams and have a greater impact on erosion.


  The study suggests salmon are at the center of a cycle of the building up and wearing down of mountains. Mountains are built by tectonic processes that lift rocks to higher elevations. In the Pacific Northwest, scientists believe, mountain-building created distinct environments that led to species “radiation” – the evolution of distinct salmon species from a common ancestor.


  Those salmon species, through their spawning, contribute to erosion that wears down the very mountains that allowed the species to develop in the first place.


  “More species means a wider range of grain size in which spawning can occur and therefore a greater impact on erosion,” Yanites said. “Thus we suggest that the radiation of salmon species in the Pacific Northwest may have lowered the elevation of mountains in the region.”


  Alexander Fremier, an associate professor in the School of the Environment at Washington State University, is the lead author of the paper. Elowyn Yager, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Idaho, is a co-author.

  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – A $1 increase in the minimum wage would likely reduce the U.S. adolescent birth rate by about 2 percent, according to new Indiana University research.


  That would mean about 5,000 fewer births annually, and the number could go higher if the minimum wage increase climbed over $1, according to Lindsey Rose Bullinger, the study author and an associate instructor and doctoral student at the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs.


  “Higher wages can give teens a reason to keep working,” Bullinger said. “Their advancement opportunities would improve, and they’d have good reason to delay childbearing or substitute work for leisure.”


  Many studies have looked at the impact of a minimum wage hike on the economy, but few have analyzed the public health implications. It is a critical issue because the U.S. has the highest adolescent birth rate among developed countries.


  Infants of teen mothers generally have worse birth outcomes than children of older mothers. Additionally, parenthood at an early age costs the public more than $9 billion annually because of expenses related to health care, foster care and foregone tax revenue from parents who leave the labor force.


  “We know from previous research that an increase in the minimum wage is good for the health of the worker,” Bullinger said. “They live longer, have lower body mass indexes and are less likely to abuse children, among other benefits. This study adds to those findings by showing that higher pay means fewer births to adolescent parents. This is especially true for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic adolescents because they are more likely to be affected by minimum wage increases.”


  The federal minimum wage is $7.25, but some cities and states have higher rates, including San Francisco and Seattle, where $15 is the hourly minimum. So increases of more than $1 are not unrealistic, which could avert even more teen births. Bullinger conducted a sophisticated statistical analysis of the differences in birth rates from state to state.


  Bullinger’s complete findings were published in the peer-reviewed article “The Effect of Minimum Wages on Adolescent Fertility: A Nationwide Analysis,” published in the American Journal of Public Health.

NSF-funded IUPUI study of non-rainfall water in Namib Desert reveals unexpected origins







For Immediate Release

            Mar 22, 2017
          












      Lixin Wang kneels in Namib Desert to check computer as Kudzai Farai Kaseke, a graduate student, observes.




  INDIANAPOLIS – In a study conducted in one of the world’s oldest and most biologically diverse deserts, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis scientists explored the origins of water other than rainfall and are identifying multiple origins. The study, supported by the National Science Foundation, is the first to report that the ocean is not the sole source of life-sustaining fog and dew for numerous plants and animals living in the Namib Desert.


  Understanding the sources of water is essential for developing ecological models of arid environments and is key to understanding how plants and animals sustain themselves and function under current or future climates.


  Fog and – to a lesser degree – dew are crucial sources of moisture in this desert environment.


  “Knowing exactly where the fog and dew come from will help us predict the availability of non-rainfall water in the future, both in the Namib and elsewhere,” said Lixin Wang, an ecohydrologist and assistant professor of earth sciences in the School of Science at IUPUI, who led the new study. “With this knowledge, we may be able to determine ways to harvest novel water sources for potential use in water-scarcity situations.”


  Surprisingly, non-ocean-derived fog accounted for more than half of the total fog events in the Namib over the one-year period of the IUPUI study. Groundwater-derived fog was the most significant locally generated fog, serving as a source of more than a quarter of the desert’s fog. Soil water, which derives from rainfall and is below the surface but located higher than groundwater, was also found by the researchers to be an unexpected source of moisture.


  Drylands, which in addition to deserts include parched but nondesert areas of the Great Plains and southwestern United States, cover approximately 40 percent of Earth’s land surface and are home to an estimated 2.5 billion people. With global warming, more areas in the United States and around the world are becoming drier and more desert-like.


  “Dryland ecosystems have some of the lowest annual rainfall amounts recorded on Earth,” said Tom Torgersen, program officer in the National Science Foundation’s Division of Earth Sciences. “To survive, these ecosystems recycle water in the form of fog and dew. In the driest places on the planet, even seemingly minor components of the water cycle, such as fog and dew, become major and are critical to keeping the environment alive and functioning.”


  Like other dryland ecosystems worldwide, the Namib is likely to experience changes in its hydrological cycle in response to global climate change. Given the abundance and importance of fog and dew in this desert, it provides an ideal location to study non-rainfall water.


  The Namib, which borders the Atlantic Ocean for 1,243 miles with temperatures ranging from below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), is almost completely devoid of surface water. Many parts of the Namib receive virtually no rain. Some years are rainless; in other years, there may be only an inch or two of rain, although some areas may receive as many as four inches. But the Namib does support a wide variety of specially adapted organisms, such as a fog-harvesting beetle. Most of the Namib’s plants and animals are believed to obtain moisture from fog or dew during rainless periods to be able to survive.


  Fog consists of tiny droplets of water suspended in air, and dew consists of tiny droplets that form on the surface of plants, soil and other objects on the ground.


  Wang’s research focuses on the intersection of hydrology, ecology and isotope geochemistry. He used analysis of stable isotopes in water – the same element with different neutron numbers in the nuclei such as of hydrogen and oxygen – to trace the origins of non-rainfall water. In future research, he plans to explore the mechanisms by which groundwater and soil water become fog and dew. The long-term goal is to expand this ecohydrology research beyond the Namib to a global scale.


“Non-rainfall Water Origins and Formation Mechanisms” is published online in Science Advances, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Study authors, along with Wang, are Kudzai Farai Kaseke and Mary K. Seely. Kaseke is an IUPUI doctoral student in Wang’s group who accompanied Wang on the field research for the study and is the first author of this publication. Seely is a desert ecologist and the former director of the Gobabeb Research and Training Center in Namibia who has studied the Namib for more than half a century.

Service-learning course reaches local residents with memory loss through music








            Apr 12, 2017
          









  With the shades drawn and the lights dimmed, students in Jennie Gubner’s Music and Memory class sit in a circle and watch a film.


  It shows an older adult man seated in a chair. He’s wearing headphones, but there is no sound. His eyes are closed. He might even be asleep.

  Then, his hand twitches, and his eyes open. He starts singing.


  All around the classroom, Gubner’s students are smiling.


  The power of music


  In less than a minute, the power of music is illustrated in a video featuring an individual with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease at a local health care facility in Bloomington.


  Gubner’s service-learning course is a mix of neuroscience, ethnomusicology, film workshop, health care studies and so much more.


  “It’s an interdisciplinary, hands-on course,” she said. “We explore the relationship between music, memory and the brain through fieldwork, filmmaking and service work in the local Bloomington community.”


  Gubner is a visiting lecturer in the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology and taught Music and Memory for the first time at IU Bloomington this spring. Throughout the course, her 18 students visit with about 18 local residents who are in nursing homes or involved in senior adult programs – the majority of whom have been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.


  The students work in pairs and meet with the older adult, their family and the facility’s staff to make a personalized music playlist that can be kept on an iPod after the class has finished.


  They also record their interactions with the senior citizens on video and keep a hand-written log of their weekly visits.


  Their films show older adults swaying from side-to-side, singing along to Frank Sinatra’s “The Way You Look Tonight” and dancing to Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire.”


  While listening to a familiar tune may seem like a simple way to pass the time, it’s doing much more than that for the senior citizens the students are interacting with.


  “We’re not just doing it for fun, because it’s a nice idea or because we need to fill people’s time,” said Cathleen Weber, owner and executive director of the Better Day Club, an adult day program in Bloomington partnering with Gubner’s class. “This becomes something really useful and adaptable to them for the remainder of their disease process.”


  The students create a personalized music history for the people they are interacting with. Listening to the music brings the senior citizens joy, but it can also be calming and bring them back to themselves, she said.


  “Music works in a different part of our brains than our language center, and as a result, it is accessible to us long after our expressive abilities and language erodes through the process of dementia,” Weber said. “Music does not replace all medication, but it can certainly alleviate some of the symptoms and the challenges that we traditionally use medicine for.”


  Once the playlists are done, Gubner and her students spend time talking with residents, caregivers, family and staff to advocate the use of these playlists as a targeted approach to combatting anxiety, depression, memory loss, and other symptoms associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s like sundowning, a syndrome of Alzheimer’s when people tend to feel much worse around dusk and can become agitated. This shift, from understanding music solely as a form of entertainment, to embracing its ability to actively promote health and wellness, is at the heart of the culture change Gubner is working to promote.

  At the start of the class, students supplied the older adult and their families with a questionnaire that asked about preferred styles of music, favorite artists or genres and, most importantly, if there are particular songs or artists associated with moments in their lives.


  As the older adult listens to a certain tune or artist, they return to the moment when they danced at their wedding, when they turned on the radio during their first date or when they attended their first concert live.


  Reality is a roller coaster


  Back in Gubner’s classroom, sophomore Nathan Siddell talked about the film he just shared of the 101-year-old who seemingly woke up and began singing.


  “He’s usually very taciturn, reserved,” Siddell said. “It was fun to actually get something out of him when he was listening to the music.”


  The field work Gubner’s students are doing isn’t always fun, however. While they often see breakthroughs with the people they’re working with and are excited to interact with them each week, they are also faced with the reality of the populations they work with.


  Maggie Kennedy, a freshman studying neuroscience, shared a video clip of her interview with a husband who spoke candidly about his wife’s experience with Alzheimer’s, and the reasons he decided to sign her up for the Music and Memory program.


  “The idea is to have joy and to have pleasure, because frankly, if you are in her position where you can only look forward to losing one faculty after another, there really is no purpose in living,” he said.


  “The disease is like a roller coaster,” Kennedy said when she explained why she chose to share the clip with her classmates. “It was very real, and I think it was very important.”


  For freshman Emily Mangione, it was her firsthand experience with Alzheimer’s that made her want to join the class.


  “My grandma has Alzheimer’s and has been in a nursing home,” she said. “She was in a band; my family is musical. At family parties, I can see how music affects her. It changes her mood.”


  Mangione, a pre-nursing major, plans to go home and use what she’s learned in Gubner’s class to help her grandmother and to try to get the Music and Memory Program implemented at her nursing home.


  Expanding Music and Memory


  Gubner’s course is based on the Music and Memory Program offered by a nonprofit organization developed by social worker Dan Cohen. Through her service-learning course, Gubner has helped to get two facilities in Bloomington certified in the program.


  “There were no facilities in the Bloomington area certified when I was offered this job last spring,” Gubner said. ”After months of phone calls and meetings explaining the benefits of the program, I was delighted to find immediate support from Cathleen Weber at the Better Day Club and Meghan Yoder at Gentry Park Senior Living.”


  The certification for a large facility is $1,000 and includes training the facility’s staff, ongoing online support and resources, and the cost of some iPods. For many facilities, the cost is too much.


  Gubner’s students have become so passionate about their work in the class that they’ve started a Music and Memory Club at IU. They have also created their own GoFundMe site with a goal of raising $2,500 by the end of the semester to certify two more Bloomington facilities in the program.


  The motivation of Gubner’s students to raise awareness is a reflection of the excitement they feel during the class as they develop relationships with the individuals they are working with.


  “The work they are doing and the films they are producing are phenomenal,” Gubner said. “They are very emotional coming out of the field. They want to share these experiences and stories with others, and film gives them the opportunity to do so.”


  “I think the students have been joyfully and happily surprised at how much these older adults have to offer,” Weber said. “They have so much richness to share. A number of people who attend the club are retired professors from the university or retired teachers in the community. It has helped to reposition them in that role. They are teaching the students about different aspects of their lives and talking about history through their music.”


  Gubner will teach the Music and Memory course in the fall. For more information or to donate a used iPod, contact her at jgubner@indiana.edu.

IU Food Institute expands to include library with food resources








            Apr 12, 2017
          









  Between offering food demos, hosting local and national speakers on campus, facilitating student discussion groups and moving into a new building, the IU Food Institute has had an exciting year.





      The IU Food Institute has over 1,000 books and resources in its new library.Photo by Bailey Briscoe, IU Communications
    



  The IU Food Institute incorporates the IU Food Project and is an initiative by the College of Arts and Sciences to support and expand upon the food-related research and courses on the Bloomington campus. One of its main goals is to find innovative ways to address what we eat and how we eat, with an environmental focus.


  The institute found its home on campus at 405/407 N. Park St. in the fall. And inside its new building is a research library full of volumes on food history, culture, cultivation and cooking, now open to the IU community.


  “The IUFI is already a place where people interested in food from across the university can meet, plan and host events,” said Leigh Bush, a graduate fellow at the IU Food Institute and a Ph.D. candidate in IU’s food studies program. “The library adds to this creative community by also being a place where everyone can come to find resources relating to food that would otherwise be difficult to track down or aren’t available in one space. This is about creating a welcome space for knowledge exchange that is yet to exist for food-interested scholars across disciplines.”


  The collection includes over 1,000 books and resources, featuring titles such as, “Against the Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization” and “Cheese: A Connoisseur’s Guide to the World’s Best.” Many of the books were donated to the library, and the collections bear the names of their donors, such as Sidney Mintz, one of the founders of contemporary food anthropology, and Christine Barbour, a local food lover and senior lecturer at IU. Several of the books are rare, and a few of them are even signed by the authors.

  “We’re excited and fortunate to have this amazing collection of books, many of which have been donated by top food studies scholars around the country,” said Madeline Chera, an IU Food Institute graduate fellow and cultural anthropology Ph.D. student. “We’re happy to be able to collect research and reference materials under one roof where we can bring scholars from across the disciplines together to form new connections and collaborations.”


  And the library’s collection continues to expand. After her visit to campus, famous chef and food activist Alice Waters offered up parts of her collection for donation to the library.


  All of the resources are available for use on-site at the IU Food Institute Library, and the goal is to become a lending library for faculty, staff and students in the future.


  With the summer quickly approaching, the IU Food Institute will have reduced hours. However, the library and other resources will be available by appointment.

Study: Wraparound services hold great promise for reducing health costs and improving outcomes







For Immediate Release

            Oct 2, 2018
          









  When Eskenazi Health in Indianapolis began offering on-site dietetics, social work and other wraparound services at its clinics, it did more than improve patient outcomes. It potentially saved millions of dollars in hospitalization costs.

  A new paper co-authored by Lisa Harris, CEO of Eskenazi Health, Paul Halverson, founding dean of the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI, and Joshua Vest, lead author of the paper and an associate professor of health policy and management at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, finds that the wraparound services, co-located within the primary care setting of the large urban safety-net health provider, were associated with a reduction in the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits.


  “Providing nonmedical wraparound services in conjunction with primary care is one strategy to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall health care spending,” Vest said.





      Joshua Vest
    



  Researchers estimated that wraparound services potentially saved $8.2 million from 2011 to 2016, based on median hospitalization costs. The estimate represents an average of $1.4 to $2.4 million potential cost savings per year.


  Researchers calculated the potential savings by estimating the number of hospitalizations that could have been expected among those receiving wraparound services had the services not been offered.


  “Early intervention and effective chronic disease management are vital to keeping people out of the hospital and reducing the burden of illness on the patient and on the health care system,” said Dr. Lisa Harris, CEO of Eskenazi Health. “We know, based on our research, that our best opportunity to improve the lives of our patients and, by extension, the health and vitality of our community lies in helping individuals stay well.”

  In 2011, Eskenazi Health began employing various providers of wraparound services including behavioral health, social work, dietetics, respiratory therapy for asthma education, patient navigation, pharmacist education, financial counseling and a medical-legal partnership.


  Wraparound services were also associated with a 5 percent reduction in the number of emergency department visits in the year after the services were provided. Researchers did not estimate potential cost savings for emergency department visits because emergency department costs were not available.


  “Given that health and health care use are largely driven by social situations, environmental context and individual behavior, we believe that addressing these issues holds great promise for reducing costs and improving health outcomes,” Halverson said.

  “Historically, the health care system has not addressed these drivers of health and health care costs,” Halverson said.


  All patients in the study received at least one wraparound service. Counseling from a dietitian was the most common wraparound service, at 49 percent, followed by consultation with a social worker at 29 percent and behavioral health at 10 percent.


  Given that wraparound services were co-located with primary care, caution must be taken in generalizing the study’s findings to settings that rely on referrals to outside social service providers, the researchers said.


  The paper, “Indianapolis Provider’s Use of Wraparound Services Associated with Reduced Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits,” was published in the journal Health Affairs. Additional authors are Dawn Haut, CEO of Eskenazi Health Center and an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine; and Nir Menachemi, professor of health policy and management and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Fairbanks School of Public Health.

Study finds STEM achievement gaps shrink by nearly half when faculty view intelligence as malleable


            First universitywide analysis of its type finds professors’ ‘growth mindsets’ are associated with better educational outcomes for all students, especially underrepresented minorities
          






For Immediate Release

            Feb 15, 2019
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – In a major analysis of university faculty and students in science, technology, engineering and math, Indiana University social psychologists have found that professors’ beliefs about intelligence play a measurable role in the success of all students in STEM, especially underrepresented minorities.


  The results of the study, published in the journal Science Advances, were presented today during a press conference at the 2019 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C.


  “In a universitywide sample, we found that all students – and black, Latino and Native American students in particular – earn significantly higher grades in STEM courses when their professors believe intelligence is a malleable quality that can be developed over time, compared to when their professors believe intelligence is a fixed trait that cannot change very much,” said first author Elizabeth Canning, a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Mary Murphy, a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who is the study’s principal investigator.

  Moreover, the researchers found that all students did better on average in classes taught by faculty who endorsed more of a growth mindset.Black, Latino and Native American students earned 0.19 fewer GPA points in fixed-mindset classrooms compared to white or Asian students. This gap shrank nearly in half – to 0.10 fewer GPA points – in growth-mindset classrooms.


  “Students in growth-mindset classrooms reported being ‘motivated to do their best work’ and felt their instructor really cared about their learning and development in classes,” Canning said.

  Classroom practices and behaviors that convey a fixed or a growth mindset have been identified by Murphy and colleagues’ previous research. Faculty who endorse fixed-mindset beliefs tend to prize flawless performance, for example, while faculty who endorse growth-mindset beliefs tend to value and praise the process of learning, and use mistakes as learning opportunities.


  To conduct the study, the researchers collected data on 150 faculty and 15,000 students over two years at a large public research university. The study also found that faculty mindset beliefs predicted the racial achievement gaps in their classes more than any other variable, including the faculty member’s gender, race, age, tenure status or teaching experience.


  “Younger and older faculty – as well as male and female professors from any racial-ethnic background – were equally likely to endorsed fixed ideas about intelligence,” Murphy said.

  Murphy’s lab is working in collaboration with the IU Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning to create educational modules for first-time university instructors that review the influence of faculty mindset beliefs on student outcomes and provide evidence-based practices that convey growth-mindset beliefs to students in the classroom. She and collaborators have also developed an institute in the Seattle area that trains K-6 teachers to create growth-mindset cultures in their classrooms.


  “The overall message here is quite optimistic,” Murphy said. “It’s clear that helping faculty understand how to employ growth-mindset practices in their teaching could help thousands of students. After all, faculty set the culture of their classroom; they are the culture creators. This work shows professors have the power to shape students’ motivation, engagement and performance through the mindset culture they create. We need to educate faculty about how their beliefs shape students’ motivation and performance and give them tools to support students in the classroom.”


  Other authors on the paper are Dorainne Green, a postdoctoral researcher at IU, and Katherine Muenks, a postdoctoral researcher at IU at the time of the study. This work was supported in part by a National Science Foundation CAREER award to Murphy.

Indiana University Herbarium completes massive plant digitization project


            The digitization of more than 160,000 plant specimens will provide access to data to researchers across the globe
          






For Immediate Release

            Apr 11, 2019
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University has completed work to make publicly available its collection of more than 160,000 preserved plant specimens, including over 72,000 specimens representing Indiana flora.

  The project, launched in 2014, provides online access to the complete collection of the IU Herbarium. This information is valuable to the global plant research community, as well as backyard gardeners and nature enthusiasts who wish to learn more about the plants in their environment.


  “This 21st-century digital herbarium is a gift to the people of Indiana,” said Eric Knox, director of the IU Herbarium and a senior scientist in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Biology. “The botanical information system fundamentally transforms how people identify plants and how researchers conduct science. Hoosiers no longer need an elaborate vocabulary of Greek and Latin technical terms to identify their state’s native and naturalized flora.”


  The IU Herbarium was founded in 1885, and its largest single collection is the preserved plant samples of Charles and Stella Deam, the first state forester of Indiana and his wife, who published “Flora of Indiana” in 1940. Many of the other specimens, whose origins span 85 countries, joined the collection over decades through the efforts of IU researchers.


  “The digitization of the IU Herbarium is the culmination of five years of continuous effort to transform the university’s priceless collection of flora – entrusted to IU by generations of scientists – into a resource accessible to experts across the world,” IU President Michael A. McRobbie said. “The project’s completion also represents a major success within the larger framework of IU’s digitization and preservation activities under the IU Bicentennial and exports a small part of our state’s spectacular natural beauty to the global community.”


  Each record in the IU Digital Herbarium includes a high-resolution photo of the preserved plant specimen, its scientific name and taxonomic placement, its collection location, and the name of the person who collected it. Many entries also contain links to the plant’s genomic data. The collection is divided into five major plant categories: algae, bryophytes (mosses), fungi, lichens and vascular plants.


  The IU Digital Herbarium also includes common plant names, which opens the collection to the general public. Users can search plants in certain regions based upon physical characteristics to help identify plants on a nature walk or distinguish native plants from invasive species.

  For example, Bloomington residents can search plants within the Monroe County Checklist. Public checklists were also created for other state counties and ecoregions, as well as parks such as Indiana Dunes National Park, Fort Harrison State Park and Mounds State Park. IU is working with the Indiana Department of Nature Resources and NICHES Land Trust to create lists for other conservation areas in Indiana, and any user can also create a checklist.


  The database also contains high-resolution images of live plants for most Indiana species, some of which were collected by members of the IU Herbarium. The data is cross-referenced against the text of “Flora of Indiana” and Gleason and Cronquist’s “Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada” – a major text in the world of botany – to provide greater historical detail about the plants and improve searchability.


  “The inclusion of common names and familiar images in the database, which helps make this information broadly accessible, is possible in part by the university’s sustained, multiyear commitment to digitizing this collection,” Knox said.


  Because the IU Herbarium’s data is housed within a larger network of 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections across the U.S., IU’s improvements to the collection also benefit many other institutions in the system, including the over 130 other herbaria across the Midwest.


  Moreover, the IU Herbarium collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to improve the accuracy of the geocoordinates that indicate the collection point of each plant in the system. The resulting system, which overlays historical data with current Google maps, is available to the public at GEOLocate.


  The IU Herbarium also partnered with the IU Libraries and University Information and Technology Services to ensure access to the many terabytes required to store images in the collection. The Imago system is also available to other Indiana herbaria. It is supported by Jetstream cloud technology operated by IU Research Technologies, part of the Pervasive Technology Institute at IU.


  “A significant amount of data on Indiana’s flora is now available to the larger research community, and the task of identifying plants in any of Indiana’s 92 counties has been vastly simplified,” Knox said. “These new online tools will enable everyone, from scientists to nonexperts, to gain a greater knowledge and appreciation of our natural world.”


  Additional support for the IU Digital Herbarium was provided by the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences, the IU Bloomington Department of Biology, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research, the Office of the Vice President for Research, UITS and private donations to the IU Herbarium Fund.


  What they are saying


Heather Calloway, IU executive director of university collections: “The herbarium at Indiana University is one of our most valuable and useful resources. The plant specimens in the collection are literally priceless, as some don’t exist anymore and can be used for DNA testing, and they can also teach us about climate change, conservation and habitat loss. Eric Knox and his team have spent five years working tirelessly to bring this gift to the people of Indiana for research and education, and I expect some of our other collections to pursue similar projects in the coming years.”


Craig Stewart, executive director of the Pervasive Technology Institute: “Making available these irreplaceable images and data about the vast array of plants in the IU Herbarium – including the plants collected by Charles Deam – is of great value to the people of Indiana and one of the reasons we supported hosting data from the Herbarium on the Jetstream cloud system.”

Researchers create public portal to increase understanding of COVID-19 executive orders’ impact








            Apr 30, 2020
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – Researchers in the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI are taking a closer look at executive orders issued in all 50 states meant to manage COVID-19.


  Their research will eventually allow citizens, as well as those in power, to better understand which orders worked and which did not.


  Assistant professors Peter Federman and Cali Curley are examining the two types of executive orders issued – restrictions and suspensions – and comparing each state’s actions to its total number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions include limiting gatherings, closing nonessential businesses and visitation rules. Suspensions aim to relieve pressure on citizens, business and government – such as postponing elections or extending tax deadlines.





      Peter Federman
    



  By using information to track people’s visits to retail and recreation sites, the research team can see how people’s movements aligned with the executive orders and the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in each state.


  Data is still being processed, but initial results from four states, including Indiana, reveal interesting differences in how states are managing their COVID-19 responses.


  When comparing Indiana to Montana, Florida and Ohio, it might appear that Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb issued fewer orders, but each order tended to include more substance.


  “This is indicative of a centralized approach,” Federman said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean Indiana has done less; it could mean that one single order includes multiple suspensions or restrictions rather than having separate orders for each one.”


  Similar to the other three states, Indiana’s drop in mobility appears to have occurred just prior to the stay-at-home order. While the order might be working to keep people socially distanced, it appears many had already made the decision to follow CDC guidance.





      Cali Curley
    



  Curley and Federman are creating a public portal to display their findings to help leaders better understand the impact of their decisions for the future and to help individuals hold their governments accountable.


  “Some of these suspensions have an impact on the public without the public noticing, unless they are paying close attention,” Curley said. “These aspects of the COVID-19 response may have longer-lasting impacts on transparency and accountability in local and state governance.”


  As states begin to reopen, the team’s data will provide insight into what restrictions were rolled back and how governance changed during and after the pandemic. It also will look at whether more restrictive measures – such as fines or jail time for mandate violations – led to increased social distancing.


  More information on the project is available on the O’Neill IUPUI blog.

IUPUI team awarded $112,500 to advance work on voice AI for law enforcement


            NIST Tech to Protect Challenge recognizes students, alumni for development of ‘Alexa-like’ technology
          







            May 20, 2020
          









  INDIANAPOLIS – A team of recent graduates from the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI and the School of Science at IUPUI has been awarded $70,000 from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, or NIST, for developing artificial intelligence technology to help police officers conduct their work more safely and efficiently.

  Along with funds previously awarded, NIST has granted the team a total of $112,500 under the Tech to Protect Challenge, a competition sponsored by the institute’s Public Safety Communications Research Division that provides entrepreneurs, programmers, students and others the opportunity to create solutions to public safety communications challenges faced by fire, law enforcement and emergency medical service responders.


  The support recognizes the team’s development of Zenext, a voice-command virtual assistant based on Google Assistant that helps law enforcement conduct critical tasks hands-free. The technology works similarly to Siri or Alexa.


  “This work contributes to the growing need for crisis-response technology,” said Sonny Kirkley, an adjunct assistant professor in the School of Informatics and Computing and an affiliate of the IU Crisis Technologies Innovation Lab, who is one of the team’s mentors.


  “As technologies like artificial intelligence and voice automation mature, it’s important to tailor their capabilities to specific tasks and professions,” Kirkley said. “Zenext uses voice technology to bridge the gap between police officers and dispatchers and provides connectivity to important emergency agencies like fire departments and EMS.”


  Members of the IUPUI team are:



Bhavani Prasad Rao Ejanthkar, a 2019 master’s degree graduate in computer science from the School of Science. Ejanthkar was responsible for application development on the project.
  

Aamir Khan, a 2020 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. Khan contributed software-engineering expertise to the project.
  

Swarnamouli Majumdar, a 2018 master’s degree graduate in data science from the School of Informatics and Computing. Majumdar served as the program manager and technology lead for data science and artificial intelligence on the project. She is currently a lead data analyst for data science strategy and cloud migration for the state of Indiana.
  

Mayur Srivastava, a 2019 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. Srivastava played a major role in user and market research and user testing on the project. He is currently a senior user-experience designer for the state of Indiana.
  

I Ting “Tiffany” Tseng, a 2020 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. A user-experience designer and web developer, Tseng was the key player in designing the Zenext app.
  


  The team’s other faculty mentor is Lou Lenzi, a professor of practice in the School of Informatics and Computing.


  The Tech to Protect Challenge was composed of 10 contests and 10 “code-a-thons” across the U.S. The team placed first, second and third for three different projects earlier this year at regional code-a-thons in Chicago in September and in Pittsburgh in November, winning a total of $17,500 and $25,000, respectively.


  Of the three projects the team had in competition, two were eligible for consideration in the finals. Of those, Zenext was one of only 25 finalists selected to advance to the national award competition that took place May 1.


  As the top contestant in the Voice AI category, Zenext was awarded $40,000 for receiving a top rating of “Excellent” at the national competition, as well as $30,000 of seed-round funding to support “product maturation and business development.”


  Kirkley said the IUPUI team’s work stood out due to the strength of their technology and their close partnership with local law enforcement.

  Zenext couples natural language processing and artificial intelligence with user-centered design, added Majumdar, whose earlier experiences merging text-to-speech and speech-to-text technology within an Android software-development platform sparked the initial concept for the project.


  In terms of collaboration, the team worked with the Carmel Police Department throughout the development process.


  “A police car is really a small mobile office, with a laptop, a printer, a camera – all of which are required for officers to do their job,” said Khan, who, along with other team members, participated in ride-alongs with Carmel police. “Officers need to enter license plates, type and communicate with their colleagues – often at the same time they’re conducting other tasks.”


  Zenext reduces the risk of distracted driving because, for example, officers can look up license plate numbers through voice command while pursuing drivers, he said. The technology also automates the process of entering the same information into multiple forms and gives police the power to quickly share critical information using hands-free email or radio communications, which is not possible with current equipment.


  The improvement of officer safety and “just-in-time assistance” that reduces time-on-task through natural language processing was a clear win-win for Zenext, Majumdar said.


  “I think our collaboration with law enforcement enhanced the authenticity of our project,” she added. “You need to talk to real people about real problems if you want to add value. Along with technology, I think the biggest part of our success in the competition was the human-centered design.”


  As winners in the national contest, the IUPUI team is eligible to compete for another $70,000 during the Progress Round in November. Over the next six months, the team aims to advance their prototype to the beta test stage, including working with a hardware manufacturer to integrate voice-command software and cloud technology into a custom device and with the Carmel Police Department to employ the technology in field tests.


  “NIST wants real solutions to real problems and is willing to provide the entrepreneurial funds required to create real products, thereby contributing to the Indiana economy,” Kirkley said. “Beyond funding, I think the greatest value of this competition was the opportunity to develop some real-world solutions to critical issues in public safety.”

  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University announces the creation of the Racial Justice Research Fund. Jointly supported by the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs, the fund will:


Support 25 grants providing start-up funding of up to $15,000 each for research by IU faculty focused on racial equity and justice.
  
Connect funded researchers with the university’s Foundation Relations, Business Partnerships, and Research Development teams to help the investigators secure external funding for race-related research.
  
Host an on-going Racial Justice Research Workshop series to connect researchers working on racial equity and justice issues and to engage other members of the university community.
  


  In an effort to address critical racial equity and justice issues as broadly as possible, funding will be available to IU faculty on all campuses (whether or not tenure-track), without regard for field or discipline. Black researchers or efforts that involve black graduate students or partnerships with black colleagues in other universities, industry, government or not-for-profit organizations are encouraged to apply.


  “Through the scholarly work of our faculty, the community-building initiatives of our culture centers, and our partnerships and civic engagements with the communities we serve, we are committed to a university where a diverse community can flourish,” said James C. Wimbush, vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs, dean of The University Graduate School, and the Johnson Chair for Diversity and Leadership. “The Racial Justice Research Fund is another effort to empower our faculty to apply their expertise to the translation of justified feelings of anger, frustration and uncertainty into thoughtful dialogue and action that will benefit our local and broader communities.” 


  The Racial Justice Research Fund follows a similar approach to the one IU applied to provide rapid, strategic funding for research addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Research supported by the new fund must be innovative, new or reflect a new application of existing research and, if successful, will contribute to advancing racial justice.


  “We are all members of an educational community, and as such, we must always, as part of the very core of what we do, face the challenges inherent in understanding and evaluating the ideas, assertions and arguments that come from varied perspectives, traditions, disciplines and beliefs, as we pursue our fundamental mission of searching for knowledge and truth,” Indiana University President Michael A. McRobbie said. “This initiative provides a way to engage some of IU’s best researchers in tackling these vital problems at this pivotal time in our nation’s history.”


  “Having worked closely with Vice President Wimbush as co-chairs of the committee to restart on-campus research after it was largely stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are again partnering to combat an even greater pandemic that has plagued our nation since its inception,” IU Vice President for Research Fred Cate said. “We know that research can lead to dramatic transformations in health, justice, business and society. The Racial Justice Research Fund is designed to support research necessary to achieving real and lasting racial justice in our community and across our state and nation.”


  Applications for support may be submitted using a simple online form. They will be reviewed on an on-going basis by a committee, and funding decisions will be made by the vice president for research and the vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs.

Racial and LGBT bias persists in ridesharing platforms despite mitigation efforts, IU research finds







For Immediate Release

            Jul 22, 2020
          









  BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Despite efforts by ridesharing companies to eliminate or reduce discrimination, research from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business finds that racial and LGBT bias persists.


  Platforms such as Uber, Lyft and Via responded to drivers’ biased behavior by removing information that could indicate a rider’s gender and race from initial ride requests. However, researchers still found that biases against underrepresented groups and those who indicate support for the LGBT community continued to exist after drivers accepted a ride request – when the rider’s picture would then be displayed.


  In other words, their efforts shifted some of the biased behavior until after the ride was confirmed, resulting in higher cancellation rates. Understanding whether bias has been removed also is important for ridesharing companies as they not only compete against each other but also with traditional transportation options.





      Jorge Mejia




  “Our results confirm that bias at the ride request stage has been removed. However, after ride acceptance, racial and LGBT biases are persistent, while we found no evidence of gender biases,” said Jorge Mejia, assistant professor of operations and decision technologies. “We show that signaling support for a social cause – in our case, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community – can also impact service provision. Riders who show support for the LGBT community, regardless of race or gender, also experience significantly higher cancellation rates.”


  Mejia and co-author Chris Parker, assistant professor in the information technology and analytics department at American University in Washington, believe they are the first to use support for social causes as a bias-enabling characteristic. Their article, “When Transparency Fails: Bias and Financial Incentives in Ridesharing Platforms,” is published in Management Science.


  They performed a field experiment on a ridesharing platform in fall 2018 in Washington, D.C. They randomly manipulated rider names, using those traditionally perceived to be white or Black, as well as profile pictures to observe drivers’ behavior patterns in accepting and canceling rides. To illustrate support for LGBT rights, the authors overlaid a rainbow filter on the rider’s picture profile.


  “We found that underrepresented minorities are more than twice as likely to have a ride canceled than Caucasians; that’s about 3 percent versus 8 percent,” Mejia said. “There was no evidence of gender bias.”


  Mejia and Parker also varied times of ride requests to study whether peak price periods affected bias. They found that higher prices associated with peak times alleviated some of the bias against riders from the underrepresented group, but not against those who signal support for the LGBT community.


  They believe that ridesharing companies should use other data-driven solutions to take note of rider characteristics when a driver cancels and penalize the driver for biased behavior. One possible way to punish drivers is to move them down the priority list when they exhibit biased cancellation behavior, so they have fewer ride requests. Alternatively, less-punitive measures may provide “badges” for drivers who exhibit especially low cancellation rates for minority riders.


  But, ultimately, policymakers may need to intervene, Mejia said.


  “Investments in reducing bias may not occur organically, as ridesharing platforms are trying to maximize the number of participants in the platform – they want to attract both riders and drivers,” he said. “As a result, it may be necessary for policymakers to mandate what information can be provided to a driver to ensure an unbiased experience, while maintaining the safety of everyone involved, or to create policies that require ridesharing platforms to monitor and remove drivers based on biased behavior.


  “Careful attention should be paid to these policies both before and after implementation, as unintended consequences are almost sure to follow any simple fix.”
